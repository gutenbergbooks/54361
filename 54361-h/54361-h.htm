<span class="i0">But to the effect. It happed on a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(To tell it you as shortly as I may,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy duk that highte Perithous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That felaw was to this duk Theseus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin thilke day that they were children lite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was come to Athenes, his felaw to visite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for to play, as he was wont to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in this world he loved no man so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he loved him as tenderly again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So well they loved, as old bokes sain,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That whan that on was ded, sothly to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His felaw wente and sought him doun in hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of that storie list me not to write.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Duk Perithous loved wel Arcite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had him knowe at Thebes yere by yere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finally, at request and praiere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Perithous, withouten any raunson,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duk Theseus let him out of prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frely to gon wher that him list over all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In swiche a gise as I you tellen shall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was the forword, plainly for to endite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixen Theseus and him Arcite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if so were, that Arcite were yfound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever in his lif, by day or night, o stound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In any countree of this Theseus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That with a swerd he shulde lese his hed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ther was non other remedie, ne rede.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But taketh his leve, and homeward he him speede:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him beware, his nekke lieth to wedde.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How great a sorwe suffereth now Arcite?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deth he feleth thurgh his herte smite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wepeth, waileth, crieth pitously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sleen himself he waiteth prively.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, Alas the day that I was borne!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now is me shape eternally to dwelle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only in purgatorie, but in helle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that ever I knew Perithous,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The sommer passeth, and the nightes long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encresen double wise the peines strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both of the lover and of the prisoner;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I n'ot which hath the wofuller mistere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, shortly for to say, this Palamon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetuelly is damned to prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chaines and in fetters to ben ded;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Arcite is exiled on his hed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For evermore, as out of that contree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne never more he shal his lady see.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You lovers, axe I now this question,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath the werse, Arcite, or Palamon?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on may se his lady day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in prison moste he dwellen alway:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other wher him lust may ride or go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sen his lady shal he never mo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now demeth as you liste, ye that can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I wil tell you forth, as I began.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When that Arcite to Thebes comen was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ful oft a day he swelt, and said, Alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sen his lady shal he neuer mo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, shortly, to concluden all his wo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So mochel sorwe hadde never creature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is or shal be while the world may dure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His slepe, his mete, his drinke, is him byraft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lene he wex, and drie as is a shaft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyen holwe, and grisly to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hewe salowe, and pale as ashen cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And solitary he was, and ever alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wailing all the night, making mone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he herde song or instrument,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than would he wepe, he mighte not be stent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So feble were his spirites, and so low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed so, that no man coude know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His speche ne his vois, though men it herd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his gere, for all the world he ferd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought only like the lovers maladie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ereos, but rather ylike manie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engendred of humours melancolike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beforne his hed in his celle fantastike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shortly turned was all up so doun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both habit and eke dispositioun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him, this woful lover Dan Arcite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shuld I all day of his wo endite?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whan he endured had a yere or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cruel torment, and this peine and wo,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At Thebes, in his contree, as I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a night in slepe as he him laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him thought how that the winged god Mercury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beforne him stood, and bad him be mery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His slepy yerde in hond he bare upright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hat he wered upon his heres bright:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arraied was this god, (as he toke kepe,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he was whan that Argus toke his slepe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said him thus: To Athenes shall thou wende,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with that word Arcite awoke and stert.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now trewely how sore that ever me smert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quod he, to Athenes right now wol I fare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne for no drede of deth shall I not spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To se my lady, that I love and serve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hire presence I rekke not to sterve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with that word he caught a gret mirrour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw that changed was all his colour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw his visage all in another kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right anon it ran him in his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sith his face was so disfigured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of maladie, the which he had endured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might wel, if that he bare him lowe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live in Athenes evermore unknowe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sen his lady wel nigh day by day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right anon he changed his aray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clad him as a poure labourer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all alone (save only a squier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That knew his privitie and all his cas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was disguised pourely as he was,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Athenes is he gone the nexte way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the court he went upon a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the gate he proffered his service,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drugge and draw what so men wold devise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shortly of this matere for to sayn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fell in office with a chamberlain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which that dwelling was with Emelie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was wise, and coude sone espie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every servent which that served hire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wel coud he hewen wood, and water bere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was yonge and mighty for the nones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thereto he was strong and big of bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To done that any wight can him devise.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A yere or two he was in this service,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Page of the chambre of Emelie the bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Philostrate he sayde that he hight.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But half so wel beloved man as he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne was ther never in court of his degre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was so gentil of conditioun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thurghout all the court was his renoun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sayden that it were a charite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Theseus wold enhaunse his degre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And putten him in a worshipful service,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ther as he might his vertues exercise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, within a while, his name is spronge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both of his dedes, and of his good tonge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Theseus had taken him so ner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of his chambre he made him squier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave him gold to mainteine his degre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eke men brought him out of his contre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fro yere to yere ful prively his rent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But honestly and sleighly he it spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no man wondred how that he it hadde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thre yere in this wise his lif he ladde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bare him so in pees and eke in werre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ther n'as no man that Theseus hath derre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this blisse let I now Arcite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speke I wol of Palamon a lite.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In derkenesse and horrible and strong prison<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This seven yere hath sitten Palamon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forpined, what for love and for distresse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who feleth double sorwe and hevinesse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Palamon? that love distraineth so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wood out of his wit he goth for wo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eke therto he is a prisonere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetuell, not only for a yere.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who coude rime in English proprely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His martirdom? forsoth it am not I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fel that in the seventh yere, in May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thridde night, (as olde bokes sayn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all this storie tellen more plain,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it by aventure or destinee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As when a thing is shapen, it shal be)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sone after the midnight Palamon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By helping of a frend, brake his prison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fleeth the cite faste as he may go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he had yeven drinke his gayler so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a clarre, made of a certain wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With narcotikes and opie of Thebes fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the night, though that men wold him shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gailer slept, he mighte not awake;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The night was short, and faste by the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nedes cost he moste himselven hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to a grove faste ther beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dredful foot then stalketh Palamon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For shortly this was his opinion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in that grove he wold him hide all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the night than wold he take his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Thebes ward, his frendes for to preie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Theseus to helpen him werreie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shortly, eyther he wold lese his lif,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or winnen Emelie unto his wif.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the effect, and his entente plein.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now wol I turnen to Arcite agein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That litel wist how neighe was his care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till that Fortune had brought him in the snare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The besy larke, the messager of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salewith in hire song the morwe gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And firy Phebus riseth up so bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the orient laugheth of the sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his stremes drieth in the greves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silver dropes hanging in the leves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Arcite, that is in the court real<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Theseus the squier principal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is risen, and loketh on the mery day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for to don his observance to May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembring on the point of his desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He on his courser, sterting as the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ridden to the feldes him to pley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the court, were it a mile or twey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the grove, of which that I you told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By aventure, his way he gan to hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To maken him a gerlond of the greves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it of woodbind or of hauthorn leves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud he song agen the sonne shene.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Maye, with all thy floures and thy grene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right welcome be thou, faire fresshe May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hope that I some grene here getten may.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his courser, with a lusty herte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a path he romed up and doun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ther, as by aventure this Palamon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was in a bush, that no man might him se,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sore afered of his deth was he:<br /></span>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>A gentlewoman out of an arbour in a grove seeth a great company of
knights and ladies in a dance upon the green grass; the which being
ended, they all kneel down and do honour to the daisie, some to the
Flower, and some to the Leaf. Afterward this gentlewoman learneth,
by one of these ladies, the meaning hereof, which is this: They which
honour the Flower, a thing fading with every blast, are such as look
after beauty and worldly pleasure; but they that honour the Leaf,
which abideth with the root, notwithstanding the frosts and winter
storms, are they which follow virtue and during qualities, without regard
of worldly respects.</i></p>

<span class="i2">Gret was the wo the knight had in his thought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What is my gilt? for Goddess love tell it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Crist wol we claime of him our gentillesse,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Eke every wight wot this as wel as I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If gentillesse were planted naturelly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto a certain linage doun the line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prive and apert, than wold they never fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To don of gentillesse the faire office;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of thin auncestres for hir high bountee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is a strange thing to thy persone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gentillesse cometh fro God alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than cometh our veray gentillesse of grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was no thing bequethed us with our place.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thinketh how noble, as saith Valerius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was thilke Tullius Hostilius,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And therefore, leve husbond, I thus conclude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Al be it that min auncestres weren rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet may the highe God, and so hope I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Granten me grace to liven vertuously;<br /></span>

was extracted from an ancient family of Roman
knights; that he was born to the inheritance of a
splendid fortune;<a id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that he was designed to the
study of the law, and had made considerable progress
in it, before he quitted that profession, for this
of poetry, to which he was more naturally formed.
The cause of his banishment is unknown; because
he was himself unwilling further to provoke the
emperor, by ascribing it to any other reason than
what was pretended by Augustus, which was, the
lasciviousness of his Elegies, and his Art of Love.<a id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It is true, they are not to be excused in the severity
of manners, as being able to corrupt a larger empire,
if there were any, than that of Rome; yet
this may be said in behalf of Ovid, that no man has
ever treated the passion of love with so much delicacy
of thought, and of expression, or searched into
the nature of it more philosophically than he. And
the emperor, who condemned him, had as little reason
as another man to punish that fault with so
much severity, if at least he were the author of a
certain epigram, which is ascribed to him, relating
to the cause of the first civil war betwixt himself
and Mark Antony the triumvir, which is more fulsome
than any passage I have met with in our poet.<a id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>To pass by the naked familiarity of his expressions
to Horace, which are cited in that author's life, I
need only mention one notorious act of his, in
taking Livia to his bed, when she was not only
married, but with child by her husband then living.
But deeds, it seems, may be justified by arbitrary
power, when words are questioned in a poet. There
is another guess of the grammarians, as far from
truth as the first from reason; they will have him
banished for some favours, which they say he received
from Julia, the daughter of Augustus, whom
they think he celebrates under the name of Corinna
in his Elegies; but he, who will observe the verses
which are made to that mistress, may gather from
the whole contexture of them, that Corinna was not
a woman of the highest quality. If Julia were then
married to Agrippa, why should our poet make his
petition to Isis for her safe delivery, and afterwards
condole her miscarriage; which, for aught he knew,
might be by her own husband? Or, indeed, how
durst he be so bold to make the least discovery of
such a crime, which was no less than capital, especially
committed against a person of Agrippa's rank?
Or, if it were before her marriage, he would surely
have been more discreet, than to have published an
accident which must have been fatal to them both.
But what most confirms me against this opinion, is,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that Ovid himself complains, that the true person
of Corinna was found out by the fame of his verses
to her; which if it had been Julia, he durst not
have owned; and, beside, an immediate punishment
must have followed. He seems himself more
truly to have touched at the cause of his exile in
those obscure verses:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cur aliquid vidi? cur noxia lumina feci?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Cur imprudenti cognita culpa mihi est?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Inscius Act&aelig;on vidit sine veste Dianam,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Pr&aelig;da fuit canibus non minus ille suis.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Namely, that he had either seen, or was conscious
to somewhat, which had procured him his disgrace.
But neither am I satisfied, that this was the incest
of the emperor with his own daughter: for Augustus
was of a nature too vindicative to have contented
himself with so small a revenge, or so unsafe
to himself, as that of simple banishment; but would
certainly have secured his crimes from public notice,
by the death of him who was witness to them.
Neither have historians given us any sight into such
an action of this emperor: nor would he, (the greatest
politician of his time,) in all probability, have
managed his crimes with so little secrecy, as not to
shun the observation of any man. It seems more
probable, that Ovid was either the confident of
some other passion, or that he had stumbled, by
some inadvertency, upon the privacies of Livia, and
seen her in a bath: for the words</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sine veste Dianam</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>agree better with Livia, who had the fame of chastity,
than with either of the Julias, who were both
noted of incontinency. The first verses, which were
made by him in his youth, and recited publicly, according
to the custom, were, as he himself assures
us, to Corinna: his banishment happened not until
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the age of fifty; from which it may be deduced,
with probability enough, that the love of Corinna
did not occasion it: nay, he tells us plainly, that
his offence was that of error only, not of wickedness;
and in the same paper of verses also, that the
cause was notoriously known at Rome, though it
be left so obscure to after-ages.<a id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But to leave conjectures on a subject so uncertain,<a id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and to write somewhat more authentic of
this poet. That he frequented the court of Augustus,
and was well received in it, is most undoubted:
all his poems bear the character of a court, and appear
to be written, as the French call it, <i>cavalierement</i>:
add to this, that the titles of many of his
elegies, and more of his letters in his banishment,
are addressed to persons well known to us, even at
this distance, to have been considerable in that
court.</p>

<p>Nor was his acquaintance less with the famous
poets of his age, than with the noblemen and ladies.
He tells you himself, in a particular account of his
own life, that Macer, Horace, Tibullus,<a id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Propertius,
and many others of them, were his familiar friends,
and that some of them communicated their writings
to him; but that he had only seen Virgil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>If the imitation of nature be the business of a
poet, I know no author, who can justly be compared
with ours, especially in the description of the
passions. And, to prove this, I shall need no other
judges than the generality of his readers: for, all
passions being inborn with us, we are almost equally
judges, when we are concerned in the representation
of them. Now I will appeal to any man, who
has read this poet, whether he finds not the natural
emotion of the same passion in himself, which the
poet describes in his feigned persons. His thoughts,
which are the pictures and results of those passions,
are generally such as naturally arise from those disorderly
motions of our spirits. Yet, not to speak
too partially in his behalf, I will confess, that the
copiousness of his wit was such, that he often writ
too pointedly for his subject, and made his persons
speak more eloquently than the violence of their
passion would admit: so that he is frequently witty
out of season; leaving the imitation of nature, and
the cooler dictates of his judgment, for the false applause
of fancy. Yet he seems to have found out
this imperfection in his riper age; for why else
should he complain, that his Metamorphoses was
left unfinished? Nothing sure can be added to the
wit of that poem, or of the rest; but many things
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
ought to have been retrenched, which I suppose
would have been the business of his age, if his misfortunes
had not come too fast upon him. But
take him uncorrected, as he is transmitted to us,
and it must be acknowledged, in spite of his Dutch
friends, the commentators, even of Julius Scaliger
himself, that Seneca's censure will stand good against
him;</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nescivit quod bene cessit relinquere</i>:<br /></span>

</div>

<p>he never knew how to give over, when he had done
well, but continually varying the same sense an
hundred ways, and taking up in another place what
he had more than enough inculcated before, he
sometimes cloys his readers, instead of satisfying
them; and gives occasion to his translators, who
dare not cover him, to blush at the nakedness of
their father. This, then, is the allay of Ovid's writings,
which is sufficiently recompensed by his other
excellencies: nay, this very fault is not without its
beauties; for the most severe censor cannot but be
pleased with the prodigality of his wit, though at
the same time he could have wished that the master
of it had been a better manager. Every thing
which he does becomes him; and if sometimes he
appears too gay, yet there is a secret gracefulness
of youth, which accompanies his writings, though
the staidness and sobriety of age be wanting. In
the most material part, which is the conduct, it is
certain, that he seldom has miscarried: for if his
Elegies be compared with those of Tibullus and
Propertius, his contemporaries, it will be found, that
those poets seldom designed before they writ; and
though the language of Tibullus be more polished,
and the learning of Propertius, especially in his fourth
book, more set out to ostentation; yet their common
practice was to look no further before them than the
next line; whence it will inevitably follow, that they
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
can drive to no certain point, but ramble from one subject
to another, and conclude with somewhat, which
is not of a piece with their beginning:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Purpureus lat&egrave; qui splendeat, unus et alter<br />
Assuitur pannus</i>,&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>as Horace says; though the verses are golden, they
are but patched into the garment. But our poet
has always the goal in his eye, which directs him in
his race; some beautiful design, which he first establishes,
and then contrives the means, which will
naturally conduct him to his end. This will be evident
to judicious readers in his Epistles, of which
somewhat, at least in general, will be expected.</p>

<p>The title of them in our late editions is <i>Epistol&aelig;
Heroidum</i>, the Letters of the Heroines. But Heinsius
has judged more truly, that the inscription of
our author was barely, Epistles; which he concludes
from his cited verses, where Ovid asserts this
work as his own invention, and not borrowed from
the Greeks, whom (as the masters of their learning)
the Romans usually did imitate. But it appears
not from their writings, that any of the Grecians
ever touched upon this way, which our poet therefore
justly has vindicated to himself. I quarrel not
at the word <i>Heroidum</i>, because it is used by Ovid
in his Art of Love:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Jupiter ad veteres supplex</i> Heroidas <i>ibat.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But, sure, he could not be guilty of such an oversight,
to call his work by the name of <i>Heroines</i>,
when there are divers men, or heroes, as, namely,
Paris, Leander, and Acontius, joined in it. Except
Sabinus, who writ some answers to Ovid's Letters,</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>Quam celer &egrave; toto rediit meus orbe Sabinus</i>,)<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I remember not any of the Romans, who have treated
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
on this subject, save only Propertius, and that
but once, in his Epistle of Arethusa to Lycotas,
which is written so near the style of Ovid, that it
seems to be but an imitation; and therefore ought
not to defraud our poet of the glory of his invention.</p>

<p>Concerning the Epistles, I shall content myself
to observe these few particulars: first, that they are
generally granted to be the most perfect pieces of
Ovid, and that the style of them is tenderly passionate
and courtly; two properties well agreeing
with the persons, which were heroines, and lovers.
Yet, where the characters were lower, as in &OElig;none
and Hero, he has kept close to nature, in drawing
his images after a country life, though perhaps he
has romanized his Grecian dames too much, and
made them speak, sometimes, as if they had been
born in the city of Rome, and under the empire of
Augustus. There seems to be no great variety in
the particular subjects which he has chosen; most
of the Epistles being written from ladies, who were
forsaken by their lovers: which is the reason that
many of the same thoughts come back upon us in
divers letters: but of the general character of women,
which is modesty, he has taken a most becoming
care; for his amorous expressions go no
further than virtue may allow, and therefore may
be read, as he intended them, by matrons without
a blush.</p>

<p>Thus much concerning the poet: it remains that
I should say somewhat of poetical translations in
general, and give my opinion, (with submission to
better judgments,) which way of version seems to
be the most proper.</p>

<p>All translation, I suppose, may be reduced to
these three heads.</p>

<p>First, that of metaphrase, or turning an author
word by word, and line by line, from one language
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
into another. Thus, or near this manner, was Horace
his Art of Poetry translated by Ben Jonson. The
second way is that of paraphrase, or translation
with latitude, where the author is kept in view by
the translator, so as never to be lost, but his words
are not so strictly followed as his sense; and that
too is admitted to be amplified, but not altered.
Such is Mr Waller's translation of Virgil's fourth
&AElig;neid. The third way is that of imitation, where
the translator (if now he has not lost that name)
assumes the liberty, not only to vary from the words
and sense, but to forsake them both as he sees occasion;
and, taking only some general hints from
the original, to run divisions on the ground-work, as
he pleases. Such is Mr Cowley's practice in turning
two Odes of Pindar, and one of Horace, into
English.</p>

<p>Concerning the first of these methods, our master
Horace has given us this caution:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Interpres</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor word for word too faithfully translate;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>as the Earl of Roscommon has excellently rendered
it. Too faithfully is, indeed, pedantically: it is
a faith like that which proceeds from superstition,
blind and zealous. Take it in the expression of Sir
John Denham to Sir Richard Fanshaw, on his version
of the Pastor Fido:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That servile path thou nobly dost decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tracing word by word, and line by line:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new and nobler way thou dost pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make translations and translators too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They but preserve the ashes, thou the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True to his sense, but truer to his fame.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is almost impossible to translate verbally, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
well, at the same time; for the Latin (a most severe
and compendious language) often expresses that in
one word, which either the barbarity, or the narrowness,
of modern tongues cannot supply in more.
It is frequent, also, that the conceit is couched in
some expression, which will be lost in English:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Atque iidem venti vela fidemque ferent</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>What poet of our nation is so happy as to express
this thought literally in English, and to strike wit,
or almost sense, out of it?</p>

<p>In short, the verbal copier is encumbered with so
many difficulties at once, that he can never disentangle
himself from all. He is to consider, at the
same time, the thought of his author, and his words,
and to find out the counterpart to each in another
language; and, besides this, he is to confine himself
to the compass of numbers, and the slavery of
rhyme. It is much like dancing on ropes with fettered
legs: a man may shun a fall by using caution;
but the gracefulness of motion is not to be expected:
and when we have said the best of it, it is but
a foolish task; for no sober man would put himself
into a danger for the applause of escaping without
breaking his neck. We see Ben Jonson could not
avoid obscurity in his literal translation of Horace,
attempted in the same compass of lines: nay, Horace
himself could scarce have done it to a Greek
poet:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio</i>:<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>either perspicuity or gracefulness will frequently be
wanting. Horace has indeed avoided both these
rocks in his translation of the three first lines of Homer's
Odyssey, which he has contracted into two:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dic mihi, musa virum, capt&aelig; post tempora Troj&aelig;,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Que mores hominum multorum vidit, et urbes</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Muse speak the man, who, since the siege of Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many towns, such change of manners saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i14"><span class="smcap">Roscommon.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But then the sufferings of Ulysses, which are a
considerable part of that sentence, are omitted:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ὃς μάλα πολλὰ πλὰγχθη.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>


<p>The consideration of these difficulties, in a servile,
literal translation, not long since made two of
our famous wits, Sir John Denham,<a id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and Mr Cowley,
to contrive another way of turning authors into
our tongue, called, by the latter of them, imitation.
As they were friends, I suppose they communicated
their thoughts on this subject to each other;
and therefore their reasons for it are little different,
though the practice of one is much more
moderate. I take imitation of an author, in their
sense, to be an endeavour of a later poet to write
like one, who has written before him, on the same
subject; that is, not to translate his words, or to
be confined to his sense, but only to set him as a
pattern, and to write, as he supposes that author
would have done, had he lived in our age, and in
our country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet I dare not say, that either of
them have carried this libertine way of rendering
authors (as Mr Cowley calls it) so far as my definition
reaches; for, in the Pindaric odes, the customs
and ceremonies of ancient Greece are still preserved.
But I know not what mischief may arise
hereafter from the example of such an innovation,
when writers of unequal parts to him shall imitate
so bold an undertaking. To add and to diminish
what we please, which is the way avowed by him,
ought only to be granted to Mr Cowley, and that
too only in his translation of Pindar; because he
alone was able to make him amends, by giving him
better of his own, whenever he refused his author's
thoughts. Pindar is generally known to be a dark
writer, to want connection, (I mean as to our understanding,)
to soar out of sight, and leave his reader
at a gaze. So wild and ungovernable a poet
cannot be translated literally; his genius is too
strong to bear a chain, and, Samson-like, he shakes
it off. A genius so elevated and unconfined as Mr
Cowley's, was but necessary to make Pindar speak
English, and that was to be performed by no other
way than imitation.<a id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>But if Virgil, or Ovid, or
any regular intelligible authors, be thus used, it is
no longer to be called their work, when neither the
thoughts nor words are drawn from the original;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
but instead of them there is something new produced,
which is almost the creation of another hand.
By this way, it is true, somewhat that is excellent
may be invented, perhaps more excellent than the
first design; though Virgil must be still excepted,
when that perhaps takes place. Yet he who is inquisitive
to know an author's thoughts, will be disappointed
in his expectation; and it is not always
that a man will be contented to have a present
made him, when he expects the payment of a debt.
To state it fairly; imitation of an author is the
most advantageous way for a translator to shew himself,
but the greatest wrong which can be done to
the memory and reputation of the dead. Sir John
Denham (who advised more liberty than he took
himself) gives his reason for his innovation, in his
admirable preface before the translation of the second
&AElig;neid. "Poetry is of so subtile a spirit, that,
in pouring out of one language into another, it will
all evaporate; and, if a new spirit be not added in
the transfusion, there will remain nothing but a <i>caput
mortuum</i>." I confess this argument holds good
against a literal translation; but who defends it?
Imitation and verbal version are, in my opinion, the
two extremes which ought to be avoided; and
therefore, when I have proposed the mean betwixt
them, it will be seen how far his argument will
reach.</p>

<p>No man is capable of translating poetry, who,
besides a genius to that art, is not a master both of
his author's language, and of his own; nor must
we understand the language only of the poet, but
his particular turn of thoughts and expression, which
are the characters that distinguish, and as it were
individuate him from all other writers. When we
are come thus far, it is time to look into ourselves,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to conform our genius to his, to give his thought
either the same turn, if our tongue will bear it, or,
if not, to vary but the dress, not to alter or destroy
the substance. The like care must be taken of the
more outward ornaments, the words. When they
appear (which is but seldom) literally graceful, it
were an injury to the author that they should be
changed. But, since every language is so full of its
own proprieties, that what is beautiful in one, is
often barbarous, nay sometimes nonsense, in another,
it would be unreasonable to limit a translator
to the narrow compass of his author's words: it is
enough if he choose out some expression which does
not vitiate the sense. I suppose he may stretch
his chain to such a latitude; but, by innovation of
thoughts, methinks, he breaks it. By this means
the spirit of an author may be transfused, and yet
not lost: and thus it is plain, that the reason alledged
by Sir John Denham has no farther force
than to expression; for thought, if it be translated
truly, cannot be lost in another language; but the
words that convey it to our apprehension (which
are the image and ornament of that thought,) may
be so ill chosen, as to make it appear in an unhandsome
dress, and rob it of its native lustre. There
is, therefore, a liberty to be allowed for the expression;
neither is it necessary that words and lines
should be confined to the measure of their original.
The sense of an author, generally speaking, is to be
sacred and inviolable. If the fancy of Ovid be
luxuriant, it is his character to be so; and if I retrench
it, he is no longer Ovid. It will be replied,
that he receives advantage by this lopping of his
superfluous branches; but I rejoin, that a translator
has no such right. When a painter copies from the
life, I suppose he has no privilege to alter features,
and lineaments, under pretence that his picture will
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
look better: perhaps the face, which he has drawn,
would be more exact, if the eyes or nose were altered;
but it is his business to make it resemble the original.
In two cases only there may a seeming difficulty
arise; that is, if the thought be notoriously trivial,
or dishonest; but the same answer will serve for
both, that then they ought not to be translated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Et qu&aelig;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Desperes tractata nitescere posse, relinquas.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="pmb3">Thus I have ventured to give my opinion on this
subject against the authority of two great men, but
I hope without offence to either of their memories;
for I both loved them living, and reverence them
now they are dead. But if, after what I have
urged, it be thought by better judges, that the
praise of a translation consists in adding new beauties
to the piece, thereby to recompense the loss
which it sustains by change of language, I shall be
willing to be taught better, and to recant. In the
mean time, it seems to me, that the true reason
why we have so few versions which are tolerable,
is not from the too close pursuing of the author's
sense, but because there are so few, who have all
the talents which are requisite for translation, and
that there is so little praise, and so small encouragement,
for so considerable a part of learning.</p>

hands. See introductory remarks on Dryden's Translations. Johnson
gives the following account of the purpose of Dryden's preface:
</p>
<p>
"In 1680, the epistles of Ovid being translated by the poets
of the time, it was necessary (says Dr Johnson) to introduce them
by a preface; and Dryden, who on such occasions was regularly
summoned, prefixed a discourse upon translation, which was then
struggling for the liberty it now enjoys. Why it should find any
difficulty in breaking the shackles of verbal interpretation, which
must for ever debar it from elegance, it would be difficult to conjecture,
were not the power of prejudice every day observed. The
authority of Jonson, Sandys, and Holiday, had fixed the judgement
of the nation; and it was not easily believed that a better
way could be found than they had taken, though Fanshaw, Denham,
Waller, and Cowley, had tried to give examples of a different
practice."</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The poet himself plainly intimates as much in an epistle to
Fabius Maximus, where he represents himself as accusing Love of
being the cause of his exile:</p>
<p><i>O puer! exilii, decepto causa magistro.</i><br />
</p>
<p>The deity replies to this charge, by alluding to the secret cause
of his banishment, for which the loosness of his verses furnished
only an ostensible reason:</p>

<p><i>Nil nisi concessum nos te didicisse magistro,</i><br />

Bayle, who quotes and confutes the various opinions of the learned
concerning this point of secret history; and concludes, like
Dryden, by leaving it very much where he found it. Were I to
hazard a conjecture, I should rather think, with our poet, Ovid had
made some imprudent, and perhaps fortuitous discovery relating
to Livia.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Dryden speaks inaccurately, from a general recollection of the
passage; for Ovid says distinctly, that the Fates did not give him
time to cultivate the acquaintance of Tibullus, any more than of
Virgil. The entire passage runs thus:</p>
<p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Sir John Denham gives his opinion on this subject in the preface
to "The Destruction of Troy;" which he does not venture
to call a translation, but "an Essay on the second book of Virgil's
&AElig;neis."&mdash;"I conceive it is a vulgar error, in translating
poets, to affect being <i>fidus interpres</i>; let that care be with them
who deal in matters of fact, or matters of faith; but whosoever
aims at it in poetry, as he attempts what is not required, so he
shall never perform what he attempts: for it is not his business
alone to translate language into language, but poesy into poesy;
and poesy is of so subtile a spirit, that in the pouring out of one
language into another, it will all evaporate; and if a new spirit
be not added in the transfusion, there will remain nothing but a
<i>caput mortuum</i>, there being certain graces and happinesses peculiar
to every language, which give life and energy to the words;
and whosoever offers at verbal translation, shall have the misfortune
of that young traveller, who lost his own language abroad,
and brought home no other instead of it; for the grace of the Latin
will be lost by being turned into English words, and the grace
of the English by being turned into the Latin phrase."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Cowley is now so undeservedly forgotten, that it is not superfluous
to insert his own excellent account of the free mode of
translation, prefixed to his translations from Pindar. "If a man
should undertake to translate Pindar, word for word, it would be
thought that one madman had translated another; as may appear,
when he that understands not the original, reads the verbal traduction
of him into Latin prose, than which nothing seems more
raving. And sure rhyme, without the addition of wit, and the
spirit of poetry, (<i>quod nequeo monstrare et sentio tantum</i>,) would
but make it ten times more distracted than it is in prose. We
must consider, in Pindar, the great difference of time betwixt his
age and ours, which changes, as in pictures, at least the colours of
poetry; the no less difference betwixt the religions and customs of
our countries, and a thousand particularities of places, persons,
and manners, which do but confusedly appear to our eyes at so
great a distance; and, lastly, (which were enough, alone, for my
purpose,) we must consider, that our ears are strangers to the music
of his numbers, which sometimes, (especially in songs and odes,)
almost without any thing else, makes an excellent poet. For though
the grammarians and critics have laboured to reduce his verses
into regular feet and measures, (as they have also those of the
Greek and Latin comedies,) yet, in effect, they are little better
than prose to our ears: and I would gladly know what applause
our best pieces of English poesy could expect from a Frenchman
or Italian, if converted faithfully, and word for word, into French
or Italian prose. And when we have considered all this, we must
needs confess, that after all these losses sustained by Pindar, all we
can add to him by our wit and invention, (not deserting still his
subject,) is not like to make him a richer man than he was in his
own country. This is, in some measure, to be applied to all translations;
and the not observing of it is the cause, that all which
ever I yet saw are so much inferior to their originals. The like
happens, too, in pictures, from the same root of exact imitation;
which being a vile and unworthy kind of servitude, is incapable
of producing any thing good or noble. I have seen originals, both
in painting and poesy, much more beautiful than their natural objects;
but I never saw a copy better than the original: which indeed
cannot be otherwise; for men resolving in no case to shoot
beyond the mark, it is a thousand to one if they shoot not short of
it. It does not at all trouble me, that the grammarians, perhaps,
will not suffer this libertine way of rendering foreign authors to be
called translation; for I am not so much enamoured of the name
translator, as not to wish rather to be something better, though it
wants yet a name. I speak not so much all this in defence of my
manner of translating or imitating, (or what other title they please,)
the two ensuing odes of Pindar; for that would not deserve half
these words, as by this occasion to rectify the opinion of divers
men upon this matter."</p></div></div>

<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>Macareus and Canace, son and daughter to &AElig;olus, God of the
Winds, loved each other incestuously: Canace was delivered of a
son, and committed him to her nurse, to be secretly conveyed away.
The infant crying out, by that means was discovered to &AElig;olus,
who, enraged at the wickedness of his children, commanded the
babe to be exposed to wild beasts on the mountains; and withal,
sent a sword to Canace, with this message, That her crimes would
instruct her how to use it. With this sword she slew herself;
but before she died, she writ the following letter to her brother
Macareus, who had taken sanctuary in the temple of Apollo.</i></p>

<span class="i0">But why should I not shine above the rest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Leda's story seems at first to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fit example, ready formed for me.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But she was cozened by a borrowed shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under harmless feathers felt a rape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I should yield, what reason could I use?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what mistake the loving crime excuse?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fault was in her powerful lover lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of what Jupiter have I to boast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you to heroes and to kings succeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our famous race does no addition need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great alliances but useless prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one that comes herself from mighty Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go then, and boast, in some less haughty place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Phrygian blood, and Priam's ancient race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I would shew I valued, if I durst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are the fifth from Jove, but I the first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crown of Troy is powerful, I confess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I have reason to think ours no less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your letter, filled with promises of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men can good, and women pleasant call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives expectation such an ample field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As would move goddesses themselves to yield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if I e'er offend great Juno's laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yourself shall be the dear, the only cause;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either my honour I'll to death maintain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or follow you, without mean thoughts of gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that so fair a present I despise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We like the gift, when we the giver prize:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'tis your love moves me, which made you take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pains, and run such hazards for my sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have perceived, though I dissembled too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand things that love has made you do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your eager eyes would almost dazzle mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which, wild man, your wanton thoughts would shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes you'd sigh, sometimes disordered stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with unusual ardour press my hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contrive just after me to take the glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would you let the least occasion pass;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When oft I feared, I did not mind alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blushing sate for things which you have done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then murmured to myself,&mdash;he'll for my sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do any thing;&mdash;I hope 'twas no mistake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft have I read within this pleasing grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under my name, those charming words,&mdash;I love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, frowning, seemed not to believe your flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, alas! am come to write the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I were capable to do amiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not but be sensible of this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For oh! your face has such peculiar charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That who can hold from flying to your arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what I ne'er can have without offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May some blest maid possess with innocence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasure may tempt, but virtue more should move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O learn of me to want the thing you love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What you desire is sought by all mankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you have eyes, so others are not blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like you they see, like you my charms adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wish not less, but you dare venture more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! had you then upon our coasts been brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My virgin-love when thousand rivals sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You had I seen, you should have had my voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could my husband justly blame my choice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For both our hopes, alas! you come too late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another now is master of my fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More to my wish I could have lived with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet my present lot can undergo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cease to solicit a weak woman's will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And urge not her you love to so much ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me live contented as I may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make not my unspotted fame your prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some right you claim, since naked to your eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three goddesses disputed beauty's prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One offered valour, t'other crowns; but she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obtained her cause, who, smiling, promised me.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But first I am not of belief so light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think such nymphs would shew you such a sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet granting this, the other part is feigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bribe so mean your sentence had not gained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With partial eyes I should myself regard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think that Venus made me her reward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I humbly am content with human praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Goddess's applause would envy raise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But be it as you say; for, 'tis confest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men, who flatter highest, please us best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I suspect it, ought not to displease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For miracles are not believed with ease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One joy I have, that I had Venus' voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A greater yet, that you confirmed her choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That proffered laurels, promised sovereignty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juno and Pallas, you contemned for me.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And yet bear witness, O you Powers above,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dissemble you, whate'er you hear them say;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To leave off loving were your better way;   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<p class="center font09 pmb1">THE ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>&AElig;neas, the son of Venus and Anchises, having, at the destruction
of Troy, saved his Gods, his father, and son Ascanius, from the
fire, put to sea with twenty sail of ships; and, having been long
tost with tempests, was at last cast upon the shore of Libya,
where queen Dido (flying from the cruelty of Pygmalion, her
brother, who had killed her husband Sich&aelig;us) had lately built
Carthage. She entertained &AElig;neas and his fleet with great civility,
fell passionately in love with him, and in the end denied him
not the last favours. But Mercury admonishing &AElig;neas to go in
search of Italy, (a kingdom promised him by the Gods,) he readily
prepared to follow him. Dido soon perceived it, and, having
in vain tried all other means to engage him to stay, at last, in
despair, writes to him as follows.</i></p>

<span class="i0">This, when thou told'st me, struck my tender heart,<a id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such requital followed such desert.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor doubt I but the gods, for crimes like these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven winters kept thee wandering on the seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy starved companions, cast ashore, I fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself admitted to my crown and bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To harbour strangers, succour the distrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was kind enough; but, oh, too kind the rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curst be the cave which first my ruin brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, from the storm, we common shelter sought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dreadful howling echoed round the place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain nymphs, thought I, my nuptials grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought so then, but now too late I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The furies yelled my funerals from below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O chastity and violated fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exact your dues to my dead husband's name!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By death redeem my reputation lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his arms restore my guilty ghost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by my palace, in a gloomy grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is raised a chapel to my murdered love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, wreathed with boughs and wool, his statue stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pious monument of artful hands.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Last night, methought, he called me from the dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice, with hollow voice, cried, Dido, come!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She comes; thy wife thy lawful summons hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But comes more slowly, clogged with conscious fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive the wrong I offered to thy bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong were his charms, who my weak faith misled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His goddess mother, and his aged sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne on his back, did to my fall conspire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! such he was, and is, that, were he true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a blush I might his love pursue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cruel stars my birth-day did attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as my fortune opened, it must end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My plighted lord was at the altar slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wealth was made my bloody brother's gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friendless, and followed by the murderer's hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To foreign countries I removed my fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, a suppliant, from the natives' hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bought the ground on which my city stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the coast that stretches to the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en to the friendly port that sheltered thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then raised these walls, which mount into the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once my neighbours' wonder, and their fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now they arm; and round me leagues are made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My scarce established empire to invade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To man my new-built walls I must prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An helpless woman, and unskilled in war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thousand rivals to my love pretend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for my person would my crown defend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose jarring votes in one complaint agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each unjustly is disdained for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To proud Hyarbas give me up a prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that must follow, if thou goest away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to my husband's murderer leave my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to the husband he may add the wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go then, since no complaints can move thy mind;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who will in impious hands no more be borne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sacrilegious worship they disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rather would the Grecian fires sustain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps my greatest shame is still to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And part of thee lies hid within my womb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The babe unborn must perish by thy hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perish, guiltless, in his mother's fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some god, thou sayest, thy voyage does command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would the same god had barred thee from my land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same, I doubt not, thy departure steers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who kept thee out at sea so many years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thy long labours were a price so great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou, to purchase Troy, would'st not repeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Tyber now thou seek'st, to be at best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When there arrived, a poor precarious guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet it deludes thy search; perhaps it will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy old age lie undiscovered still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ready crown and wealth in dower I bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, without conquering, here thou art a king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here thou to Carthage may'st transfer thy Troy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here young Ascanius may his arms employ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while we live secure in soft repose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And thy dead father's bones in peace remain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou hast pity on unhappy me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew no crime, but too much love of thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am not born from fierce Achilles' line,<br /></span>

<p>This Dedication contains abundance of literary and political
controversy. The first heat of the Revolution had been long over,
and the losers began to assume the privilege of talking, without
fear that an established government would think their complaints
worthy of much notice. Dryden, whom the evils of degradation
and poverty pressed severely, was not of a temper to remain silent
under them, as soon as he conceived it safe to utter his grievances.
In losing his places of laureat and historiographer, there
was not only dishonour, but great pecuniary loss; nor was it at
all a soothing addition, that his old enemy Shadwell had obtained
the one, and his equivocal friend Rymer the other, of his appointments.
He sets out in extremely bad humour with the government,
under which he had suffered this deprivation; with those
who had risen by his fall; and with himself, for having cultivated
the barren field of poetry, instead of aspiring to the honours of
the gown. At length, after having ventured probably as far as he
thought safe, certainly as far as to excite displeasure, in flourishes
of declamation, which, though expressed against ministers in general,
are obviously levelled against those of the day, he turns
short, and falls with great vehemence upon the whole body of
critics, ancient and modern, as the natural enemies of poets and
poetry. Descending to those of his own day, he singles out Rymer,
who, in a piece, called, "A short View of Tragedy," published
in 1692, had depreciated the modern drama in his deep admiration
of the ancients. The controversy concerning the comparative
merits of the ancients and moderns was now raging in the
literary world. Perault had written his "Parallel," and Sir William
Temple his "Essay on Ancient and Modern Learning." Wotton's
"Reflections" were published in 1694, and these led the way to
Swift's "Battle of the Books," in which our author is treated with
great severity.</p>

<p>Rymer had not only espoused the cause of the ancient tragedians
in the general dispute, but, as Dryden complains, had treated
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
him slightly; and our bard was not famous for patience under
such offences. He therefore retorts in this Dedication, maliciously
upbraids Rymer with the fate of his fallen tragedy "Edgar;"
and artfully divides the comparison between the Grecian
and British dramatists, from that which Perault had instituted
between the ancient poets in general and those of modern France.
Our author's good taste, as well as policy, led him to take a distinction
so necessary for the maintenance of his cause. Having
bestowed what he thought an adequate chastisement upon Rymer,
he employs the small remainder of the preface in discussing a few
miscellaneous points of criticism, chiefly relating to translation.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The tone of this Dedication excited, as Dryden himself informs
us, the resentment of the court, who employed Rymer to attack
our author's dramatic reputation; a task which he never accomplished.<a id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

plays, which he assures me he is now doing. I doubt not his malice, from a
former hint you gave me; and if he be employed, I am confident 'tis of his
own seeking, who, you know, <i>has spoken slightly of me in his last critique, and
that gave me occasion to snarl again</i>."</p></div></div>

<p class="ia4">MY LORD,</p>

<p>These Miscellany Poems are by many titles yours.
The first they claim, from your acceptance of my
promise to present them to you, before some of
them were yet in being. The rest are derived from
your own merit, the exactness of your judgment in
poetry, and the candour of your nature; easy to
forgive some trivial faults, when they come accompanied
with countervailing beauties. But, after all,
though these are your equitable claims to a dedication
from other poets, yet I must acknowledge a
bribe in the case, which is your particular liking of
my verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a vanity common to all writers,
to overvalue their own productions; and it is better
for me to own this failing in myself, than the world
to do it for me. For what other reason have I
spent my life in so unprofitable a study? why am I
grown old, in seeking so barren a reward as fame?
The same parts and application, which have made
me a poet, might have raised me to any honours of
the gown, which are often given to men of as little
learning and less honesty than myself. No government
has ever been, or ever can be, wherein timeservers
and blockheads will not be uppermost. The
persons are only changed, but the same jugglings in
state, the same hypocrisy in religion, the same
self-interest and mismanagement, will remain for
ever. Blood and money will be lavished in all ages,
only for the preferment of new faces, with old
consciences. There is too often a jaundice in the
eyes of great men; they see not those whom they
raise in the same colours with other men. All
whom they affect look golden to them, when the
gilding is only in their own distempered sight.
These considerations have given me a kind of contempt
for those who have risen by unworthy ways.
I am not ashamed to be little, when I see them so
infamously great; neither do I know why the name
of poet should be dishonourable to me, if I am truly
one, as I hope I am; for I will never do any thing
that shall dishonour it. The notions of morality
are known to all men; none can pretend ignorance
of those ideas which are inborn in mankind; and
if I see one thing, and practise the contrary, I must
be disingenuous not to acknowledge a clear truth,
and base to act against the light of my own conscience.
For the reputation of my honesty, no
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
man can question it, who has any of his own; for
that of my poetry, it shall either stand by its own
merit, or fall for want of it. Ill writers are usually
the sharpest censors; for they, as the best poet and
the best patron said,</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in the full perfection of decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn vinegar, and come again in play.<a id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus the corruption of a poet is the generation of a
critic; I mean of a critic in the general acceptation
of this age; for formerly they were quite another
species of men. They were defenders of poets,
and commentators on their works;&mdash;to illustrate
obscure beauties; to place some passages in a better
light; to redeem others from malicious interpretations;
to help out an author's modesty, who is not
ostentatious of his wit; and, in short, to shield him
from the ill-nature of those fellows, who were then
called Zoili and Momi, and now take upon themselves
the venerable name of censors. But neither Zoilus,
nor he who endeavoured to defame Virgil, were
ever adopted into the name of critics by the ancients.
What their reputation was then, we know;
and their successors in this age deserve no better.
Are our auxiliary forces turned our enemies? are
they, who at best are but wits of the second order,
and whose only credit amongst readers is what they
obtained by being subservient to the fame of writers,
are these become rebels, of slaves, and usurpers, of
subjects? or, to speak in the most honourable terms
of them, are they, from our seconds, become principals
against us? Does the ivy undermine the oak,
which supports its weakness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>What labour would it
cost them to put in a better line, than the worst of
those which they expunge in a true poet? Petronius,
the greatest wit perhaps of all the Romans, yet
when his envy prevailed upon his judgment to fall
on Lucan, he fell himself in his attempt; he performed
worse in his "Essay of the Civil War" than
the author of the "Pharsalia;" and, avoiding his errors,
has made greater of his own. Julius Scaliger
would needs turn down Homer, and abdicate him
after the possession of three thousand years: has
he succeeded in his attempt? he has indeed shown
us some of those imperfections in him, which are
incident to human kind; but who had not rather
be that Homer than this Scaliger? You see the
same hypercritic, when he endeavours to mend the
beginning of Claudian, (a faulty poet, and living in
a barbarous age,) yet how short he comes of him,
and substitutes such verses of his own as deserve
the ferula. What a censure has he made of Lucan,
that "he rather seems to bark than sing?" Would any
but a dog have made so snarling a comparison? one
would have thought he had learned Latin as late as
they tell us he did Greek. Yet he came off, with a
<i>pace tu&#515;</i>,&mdash;by your good leave, Lucan; he called him
not by those outrageous names, of fool, booby, and
blockhead: he had somewhat more of good manners
than his successors, as he had much more
knowledge. We have two sorts of those gentlemen
in our nation; some of them, proceeding with
a seeming moderation and pretence of respect to
the dramatic writers of the last age, only scorn
and vilify the present poets, to set up their predecessors.
But this is only in appearance; for their
real design is nothing less than to do honour to any
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
man, besides themselves. Horace took notice of
such men in his age:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nostra sed impugnat; nos nostraque lividus odit.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is not with an ultimate intention to pay reverence
to the names of Shakespeare, Fletcher, and Ben
Jonson, that they commend their writings, but to
throw dirt on the writers of this age: their declaration
is one thing, and their practice is another.
By a seeming veneration to our fathers, they would
thrust out us, their lawful issue, and govern us themselves,
under a specious pretence of reformation.
If they could compass their intent, what would wit
and learning get by such a change? If we are bad
poets, they are worse; and when any of their woeful
pieces come abroad, the difference is so great
betwixt them and good writers, that there need no
criticisms on our part to decide it. When they describe
the writers of this age, they draw such monstrous
figures of them, as resemble none of us; our
pretended pictures are so unlike, that it is evident
we never sat to them: they are all grotesque; the
products of their wild imaginations, things out of
nature; so far from being copied from us, that they
resemble nothing that ever was, or ever can be.
But there is another sort of insects, more venomous
than the former; those who manifestly aim at the
destruction of our poetical church and state; who
allow nothing to their countrymen, either of this
or of the former age. These attack the living by
raking up the ashes of the dead; well knowing that
if they can subvert their original title to the stage,
we who claim under them must fall of course.
Peace be to the venerable shades of Shakespeare
and Ben Jonson! none of the living will presume to
have any competition with them; as they were our
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
predecessors, so they were our masters. We trail
our plays under them; but as at the funerals of a
Turkish emperor, our ensigns are furled or dragged
upon the ground, in honour to the dead, so we may
lawfully advance our own afterwards, to show that
we succeed; if less in dignity, yet on the same foot
and title, which we think too we can maintain
against the insolence of our own janizaries. If I
am the man, as I have reason to believe, who am
seemingly courted, and secretly undermined; I
think I shall be able to defend myself, when I am
openly attacked; and to show, besides, that the
Greek writers only gave us the rudiments of a stage
which they never finished; that many of the tragedies
in the former age amongst us were without
comparison beyond those of Sophocles and Euripides.
But at present, I have neither the leisure,
nor the means, for such an undertaking. It is ill
going to law for an estate, with him who is in possession
of it, and enjoys the present profits, to feed
his cause. But the <i>quantum mutatus</i> may be remembered
in due time. In the mean while, I leave the
world to judge, who gave the provocation.</p>

<p>This, my lord, is, I confess, a long digression,
from miscellany poems to modern tragedies; but I
have the ordinary excuse of an injured man, who
will be telling his tale unseasonably to his betters;
though, at the same time, I am certain you are so
good a friend, as to take a concern in all things
which belong to one who so truly honours you.
And besides, being yourself a critic of the genuine
sort, who have read the best authors in their own
languages, who perfectly distinguish of their several
merits, and, in general, prefer them to the moderns,
yet, I know, you judge for the English tragedies,
against the Greek and Latin, as well as
against the French, Italian, and Spanish, of these
latter ages. Indeed, there is a vast difference betwixt
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
arguing like Perault, in behalf of the French
poets, against Homer and Virgil, and betwixt giving
the English poets their undoubted due, of excelling
&AElig;schylus, Euripides, and Sophocles. For if we, or
our greater fathers, have not yet brought the drama
to an absolute perfection, yet at least we have carried
it much farther than those ancient Greeks;
who, beginning from a chorus, could never totally
exclude it, as we have done; who find it an unprofitable
incumbrance, without any necessity of entertaining
it amongst us, and without the possibility
of establishing it here, unless it were supported
by a public charge. Neither can we accept of those
lay-bishops, as some call them, who, under pretence
of reforming the stage, would intrude themselves
upon us, as our superiors; being indeed incompetent
judges of what is manners, what religion, and,
least of all, what is poetry and good sense. I can
tell them, in behalf of all my fellows, that when
they come to exercise a jurisdiction over us, they
shall have the stage to themselves, as they have the
laurel. As little can I grant, that the French dramatic
writers excel the English. Our authors as far
surpass them in genius, as our soldiers excel theirs
in courage. It is true, in conduct they surpass us
either way; yet that proceeds not so much from
their greater knowledge, as from the difference of
tastes in the two nations. They content themselves
with a thin design, without episodes, and managed
by few persons; our audience will not be pleased,
but with variety of accidents, an underplot, and
many actors. They follow the ancients too servilely
in the mechanic rules, and we assume too much
licence to ourselves, in keeping them only in view,
at too great a distance. But if our audience had
their tastes, our poets could more easily comply
with them, than the French writers could come up
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to the sublimity of our thoughts, or to the difficult
variety of our designs. However it be, I dare establish
it for a rule of practice on the stage, that we
are bound to please those whom we pretend to entertain;
and that at any price, religion and good
manners only excepted; and I care not much, if I
give this handle to our bad illiterate poetasters, for
the defence of their <i>Scriptions</i>, as they call them.
There is a sort of merit in delighting the spectators,
which is a name more proper for them, than that
of auditors; or else Horace is in the wrong, when
he commends Lucilius for it. But these common
places I mean to treat at greater leisure; in the
mean time submitting that little I have said to your
lordship's approbation, or your censure, and chusing
rather to entertain you this way, as you are a
judge of writing, than to oppress your modesty with
other commendations; which, though they are your
due, yet would not be equally received in this satirical
and censorious age. That which cannot, without
injury, be denied to you, is the easiness of your
conversation, far from affectation or pride; not denying
even to enemies their just praises. And this,
if I would dwell on any theme of this nature, is no
vulgar commendation to your lordship. Without
flattery, my lord, you have it in your nature, to be
a patron and encourager of good poets; but your
fortune has not yet put into your hands the opportunity
of expressing it. What you will be hereafter,
may be more than guessed, by what you are at
present. You maintain the character of a nobleman,
without that haughtiness which generally attends
too many of the nobility; and when you converse
with gentlemen, you forget not that you have
been of their order. You are married to the daughter
of a king; who, amongst her other high perfections,
has derived from him a charming behaviour,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a winning goodness, and a majestic person. The
Muses and the Graces are the ornaments of your
family; while the Muse sings, the Grace accompanies
her voice: Even the servants of the Muses
have sometimes had the happiness to hear her, and
to receive their inspirations from her.<a id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>I will not give myself the liberty of going farther;
for it is so sweet to wander in a pleasing way,
that I should never arrive at my journey's end. To
keep myself from being belated in my letter, and
tiring your attention, I must return to the place
where I was setting out. I humbly dedicate to
your lordship my own labours in this Miscellany;
at the same time, not arrogating to myself the privilege,
of inscribing to you the works of others who
are joined with me in this undertaking, over which
I can pretend no right. Your lady and you have
done me the favour to hear me read my translations
of Ovid; and you both seemed not to be displeased
with them. Whether it be the partiality of an old
man to his youngest child, I know not; but they
appear to me the best of all my endeavours in this
kind. Perhaps this poet is more easy to be translated
than some others whom I have lately attempted;
perhaps, too, he was more according to my genius.
He is certainly more palatable to the reader,
than any of the Roman wits; though some of them
are more lofty, some more instructive, and others
more correct. He had learning enough to make
him equal to the best; but, as his verse came easily,
he wanted the toil of application to amend it. He
is often luxuriant both in his fancy and expressions,
and, as it has lately been observed, not always natural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>If wit be pleasantry, he has it to excess;
but if it be propriety, Lucretius, Horace, and, above
all, Virgil, are his superiors. I have said so much
of him already in my preface to his "Heroical
Epistles," that there remains little to be added in
this place: For my own part, I have endeavoured
to copy his character, what I could, in this translation;
even, perhaps, farther than I should have
done,&mdash;to his very faults. Mr Chapman, in his
"Translation of Homer," professes to have done it
somewhat paraphrastically, and that on set purpose;
his opinion being, that a good poet is to be translated
in that manner. I remember not the reason
which he gives for it; but I suppose it is for fear of
omitting any of his excellencies. Sure I am, that if
it be a fault, it is much more pardonable than that
of those, who run into the other extreme of a literal
and close translation, where the poet is confined so
straitly to his author's words, that he wants elbow-room
to express his elegancies. He leaves
him obscure; he leaves him prose, where he found
him verse; and no better than thus has Ovid been
served by the so-much-admired Sandys. This is
at least the idea which I have remaining of his
translation; for I never read him since I was a boy.
They who take him upon content, from the praises
which their fathers gave him, may inform their
judgment by reading him again, and see (if they
understand the original) what is become of Ovid's
poetry in his version; whether it be not all, or the
greatest part of it, evaporated. But this proceeded
from the wrong judgment of the age in which he
lived. They neither knew good verse, nor loved it;
they were scholars, it is true, but they were pedants;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and, for a just reward of their pedantic pains, all
their translations want to be translated into English.</p>

<p>If I flatter not myself, or if my friends have not
flattered me, I have given my author's sense for the
most part truly; for, to mistake sometimes is incident
to all men; and not to follow the Dutch commentators
always, may be forgiven to a man, who
thinks them, in the general, heavy gross-witted fellows,
fit only to gloss on their own dull poets. But
I leave a farther satire on their wit, till I have a
better opportunity to show how much I love and
honour them. I have likewise attempted to restore
Ovid to his native sweetness, easiness, and smoothness;
and to give my poetry a kind of cadence,
and, as we call it, a run of verse, as like the original,
as the English can come up to the Latin. As
he seldom uses any synalephas, so I have endeavoured
to avoid them as often as I could. I have
likewise given him his own turns, both on the
words and on the thought; which I cannot say are
inimitable, because I have copied them, and so may
others, if they use the same diligence; but certainly
they are wonderfully graceful in this poet. Since
I have named the synalepha, which is the cutting
off one vowel immediately before another, I will
give an example of it from Chapman's "Homer,"
which lies before me, for the benefit of those who
understand not the <i>Latin prosodia</i>. It is in the first
line of the argument to the first Iliad:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Apollo's priest to th' Argive fleet doth bring, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There, we see, he makes it not, <i>the Argive</i>, but <i>th' Argive</i>,
to shun the shock of the two vowels, immediately
following each other; but, in his second argument,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in the same page, he gives a bad example
of the quite contrary kind:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alpha the prayer of Chryses sings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The army's plague, the strife of kings.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In these words, <i>the army's,&mdash;the</i> ending with a vowel,
and <i>armies</i> beginning with another vowel, without
cutting off the first, which by it had been <i>th' armies</i>,
there remains a most horrible ill-sounding gap betwixt
those words. I cannot say that I have every
where observed the rule of the synalepha in my translation;
but wheresoever I have not, it is a fault in
sound. The French and the Italians have made it
an inviolable precept in their versification; therein
following the severe example of the Latin poets. Our
countrymen have not yet reformed their poetry so
far, but content themselves with following the licentious
practice of the Greeks; who, though they
sometimes use synalephas, yet make no difficulty,
very often, to sound one vowel upon another; as
Homer does, in the very first line of Alpha:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Μήνιν ἄειδε, Θεὰ, Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is true, indeed, that, in the second line, in these
words, μυρὶ Ἀχαιοῖς, and ἀλγὲ οὒθηκε, the synalepha, in
revenge, is twice observed. But it becomes us, for
the sake of euphony, rather <i>Musas colere severiores</i>,
with the Romans, than to give into the looseness of
the Grecians.</p>

<p>I have tired myself, and have been summoned by
the press to send away this Dedication, otherwise I
had exposed some other faults, which are daily
committed by our English poets; which, with care
and observation, might be amended. For, after all,
our language is both copious, significant, and majestical,
and might be reduced into a more harmonious
sound. But, for want of public encouragement,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in this iron age, we are so far from making
any progress in the improvement of our tongue,
that in few years we shall speak and write as barbarously
as our neighbours.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my haste, I cannot forbear to
tell your lordship, that there are two fragments of
Homer translated in this Miscellany; one by Mr
Congreve, (whom I cannot mention without the
honour which is due to his excellent parts, and that
entire affection which I bear him,) and the other by
myself. Both the subjects are pathetical; and I am
sure my friend has added to the tenderness which
he found in the original, and, without flattery, surpassed
his author. Yet I must needs say this in reference
to Homer, that he is much more capable of
exciting the manly passions than those of grief and
pity. To cause admiration is, indeed, the proper
and adequate design of an epic poem; and in that
he has excelled even Virgil. Yet, without presuming
to arraign our master, I may venture to affirm,
that he is somewhat too talkative, and more than
somewhat too digressive. This is so manifest, that
it cannot be denied in that little parcel which I
have translated, perhaps too literally: there Andromache,
in the midst of her concernment and fright
for Hector, runs off her bias, to tell him a story of
her pedigree, and of the lamentable death of her father,
her mother, and her seven brothers. The devil
was in Hector if he knew not all this matter, as
well as she who told it him; for she had been his
bedfellow for many years together: and if he knew
it, then it must be confessed, that Homer, in this
long digression, has rather given us his own character,
than that of the fair lady whom he paints.
His dear friends, the commentators, who never fail
him at a pinch, will needs excuse him, by making
the present sorrow of Andromache to occasion the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
remembrance of all the past; but others think, that
she had enough to do with that grief which now
oppressed her, without running for assistance to her
family. Virgil, I am confident, would have omitted
such a work of supererogation. But Virgil had
the gift of expressing much in little, and sometimes
in silence; for, though he yielded much to Homer
in invention, he more excelled him in his admirable
judgment. He drew the passion of Dido for &AElig;neas,
in the most lively and most natural colours that are
imaginable. Homer was ambitious enough of moving
pity, for he has attempted twice on the same
subject of Hector's death; first, when Priam and Hecuba
beheld his corpse, which was dragged after the
chariot of Achilles; and then in the lamentation
which was made over him, when his body was redeemed
by Priam; and the same persons again bewail
his death, with a chorus of others to help
the cry. But if this last excite compassion in you,
as I doubt not but it will, you are more obliged to
the translator than the poet; for Homer, as I observed
before, can move rage better than he can
pity. He stirs up the irascible appetite, as our philosophers
call it; he provokes to murder, and the
destruction of God's images; he forms and equips
those ungodly man-killers, whom we poets, when
we flatter them, call heroes; a race of men who can
never enjoy quiet in themselves, until they have
taken it from all the world. This is Homer's commendation;
and, such as it is, the lovers of peace,
or at least of more moderate heroism, will never envy
him. But let Homer and Virgil contend for the
prize of honour betwixt themselves; I am satisfied
they will never have a third concurrent. I wish
Mr Congreve had the leisure to translate him, and
the world the good nature and justice to encourage
him in that noble design, of which he is more capable
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
than any man I know. The Earl of Mulgrave
and Mr Waller, two of the best judges of our age,
have assured me, that they could never read over
the translation of Chapman, without incredible
pleasure and extreme transport. This admiration
of theirs must needs proceed from the author himself;
for the translator has thrown him down as
low as harsh numbers, improper English, and a monstrous
length of verse could carry him. What then
would he appear in the harmonious version of one
of the best writers, living in a much better age
than was the last? I mean for versification, and
the art of numbers; for in the drama we have not
arrived to the pitch of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson.
But here, my lord, I am forced to break off abruptly,
without endeavouring at a compliment in the
close. This Miscellany is, without dispute, one of
the best of the kind which has hitherto been extant
in our tongue; at least, as Sir Samuel Tuke
has said before me, a modest man may praise what
is not his own. My fellows have no need of any
protection; but I humbly recommend my part of
it, as much as it deserves, to your patronage and
acceptance, and all the rest to your forgiveness. I
am,</p>

<span class="i0">And, with a native bent, did good pursue.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Unforced by punishment, unawed by fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His words were simple, and his soul sincere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Needless was written law, where none opprest;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The mountain trees in distant prospect please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet the pine descended to the seas;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And happy mortals, unconcerned for more,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Confined their wishes to their native shore. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">No walls were yet, nor fence, nor moat, nor mound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor swords were forged; but, void of care and crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soft creation slept away their time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unprovoked, did fruitful stores allow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content with food, which nature freely bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On wildings and on strawberries they fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falling acorns furnished out a feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers, unsown, in fields and meadows reigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And western winds immortal spring maintained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In following years the bearded corn ensued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From earth unasked, nor was that earth renewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From veins of vallies milk and nectar broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honey sweating through the pores of oak.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O'er M&aelig;nalus I took my steepy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By caverns infamous for beasts of prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then crossed Cyllene, and the piny shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More infamous by curst Lycaon made;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not long before, but in a luckless hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some legates, sent from the Molossian state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were on a peaceful errand come to treat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these he murders one, he boils the flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lays the mangled morsels in a dish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some part he roasts; then serves it up so drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids me welcome to this human feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved with disdain, the table I o'erturned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But human voice his brutal tongue forsook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his lips the gathered foam he churns,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">His arms descend, his shoulders sink away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To multiply his legs for chace of prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the same rage in other members reigns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes still sparkle in a narrower space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His jaws retain the grin, and violence of his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was a single ruin, but not one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves so just a punishment alone.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bound of fruitful fields, while fields they were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then a field of waters did appear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parnassus is its name, whose forky rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounts through the clouds, and mates the lofty skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the summit of this dubious cliff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deucalion wafting moored his little skiff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He with his wife were only left behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perished man; they two were human kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain-nymphs and Themis they adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her oracles relief implore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most upright of mortal men was he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most sincere and holy woman, she.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When Jupiter, surveying earth from high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld it in a lake of water lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That where so many millions lately lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But two, the best of either sex, survived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loosed the northern wind; fierce Boreas flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To puff away the clouds, and purge the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serenely, while he blows, the vapours driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discover heaven to earth, and earth to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The billows fall, while Neptune lays his mace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the rough sea, and smooths its furrowed face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already Triton, at his call, appears    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give the waves the signal to retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His writhen shell he takes, whose narrow vent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows by degrees into a large extent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gives it breath; the blast, with doubling sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs the wide circuit of the world around.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The sun first heard it, in his early east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And met the rattling echoes in the west.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters, listening to the trumpet's roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thin circumference of land appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth, but not at once, her visage rears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peeps upon the seas from upper grounds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streams, but just contained within their bounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By slow degrees into their channels crawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth increases as the waters fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In longer time the tops of trees appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which mud on their dishonoured branches bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At length the world was all restored to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But desolate, and of a sickly hue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature beheld herself, and stood aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dismal desert, and a silent waste.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which when Deucalion, with a piteous look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, he wept, and thus to Pyrrha spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh wife, oh sister, oh of all thy kind      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The best and only creature left behind,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By kindred, love, and now by dangers joined;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of multitudes, who breathed the common air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two remain, a species in a pair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest the seas have swallowed; nor have we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en of this wretched life a certainty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds are still above; and, while I speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second deluge o'er our heads may break.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I be snatched from hence, and thou remain,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Without relief, or partner of thy pain,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">How could'st thou such a wretched life sustain?  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should I be left, and thou be lost, the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That buried her I loved, should bury me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh could our father his old arts inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make me heir of his informing fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so I might abolished man retrieve,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But heaven is pleased, nor ought we to complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we, the examples of mankind, remain.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said; the careful couple join their tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then invoke the gods, with pious prayers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus in devotion having eased their grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sacred oracles they seek relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Cephisus' brook their way pursue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stream was troubled, but the ford they knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With living waters in the fountain bred,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">They sprinkle first their garments, and their head,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then took the way which to the temple led.         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The roofs were all defiled with moss and mire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The desert altars void of solemn fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gradual prostrate they adored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pavement kissed, and thus the saint implored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O righteous Themis, if the powers above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By prayers are bent to pity and to love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If human miseries can move their mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell how we may restore, by second birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mankind, and people desolated earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the gracious goddess, nodding, said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depart, and with your vestments veil your head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stooping lowly down, with loosened zones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throw each behind your backs your mighty mother's bones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed the pair, and mute with wonder, stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Pyrrha first refused the dire command.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it heaven, said she, that I should tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those holy relics from the sepulchre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pondered the mysterious words again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some new sense; and long they sought in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length Deucalion cleared his cloudy brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said; The dark &aelig;nigma will allow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A meaning, which, if well I understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sacrilege will free the god's command:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This earth our mighty mother is, the stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her capacious body are her bones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These we must cast behind. With hope, and fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woman did the new solution hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man diffides in his own augury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doubts the gods; yet both resolve to try.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descending from the mount, they first unbind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vests, and, veiled, they cast the stones behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stones (a miracle to mortal view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But long tradition makes it pass for true,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did first the rigour of their kind expel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suppled into softness as they fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then swelled, and, swelling, by degrees grew warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took the rudiments of human form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imperfect shapes, in marble such are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rude chisel does the man begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet the roughness of the stone remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the rising muscles, and the veins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sappy parts, and next resembling juice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were turned to moisture, for the body's use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supplying humours, blood, and nourishment:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, too solid to receive a bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Converts to bones; and what was once a vein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its former name and nature did retain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By help of power divine, in little space,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What the man threw, assumed a manly face;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And what the wife, renewed the female race.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hence we derive our nature, born to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laborious life, and hardened into care.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rest of animals, from teeming earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Produced, in various forms received their birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The native moisture, in its close retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Digested by the sun's etherial heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a kindly womb, began to breed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then swelled, and quickened by the vital seed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some in less, and some in longer space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were ripened into form, and took a several face.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus when the Nile from Pharian fields is fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeks with ebbing tides his ancient bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fat manure with heavenly fire is warmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crusted creatures, as in wombs, are formed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, when they turn the glebe, the peasants find:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some rude, and yet unfinished in their kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short of their limbs, a lame imperfect birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One half alive, and one of lifeless earth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So monstrous was his bulk, so large a space<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A filmy rind about her body grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair to leaves, her arms extend to boughs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nymph is all into a Laurel gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smoothness of her skin remains alone.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her bole his arms, some little warmth he found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tree still panted in the unfinished part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wholly vegetive, and heaved her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fixed his lips upon the trembling rind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It swerved aside, and his embrace declined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the god: Because thou canst not be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mistress, I espouse thee for my tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thou the prize of honour and renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deathless poet, and the poem, crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, after poets, be by victors worn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt returning C&aelig;sar's triumph grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When pomps shall in a long procession pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreathed on the post before his palace wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be the sacred guardian of the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure from thunder, and unharmed by Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfading as the immortal powers above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the locks of Ph&oelig;bus are unshorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grateful Tree was pleased with what he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook the shady honours of her head.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through this the rapid Peneus takes his course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pindus rolling with impetuous force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mists from the river's mighty fall arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deadly damps inclose the cloudy skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual fogs are hanging o'er the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sounds of waters deaf the neighbourhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in a rocky cave he makes abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mansion proper for a mourning god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here he gives audience; issuing out decrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rivers, his dependent deities.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this occasion hither they resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay their homage, and to make their court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All doubtful, whether to congratulate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter's honour, or lament her fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sperch&aelig;us, crowned with poplar, first appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then old Apidanus came, crowned with years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enipeus turbulent, Amphrysos tame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &AElig;as, last, with lagging waters came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then of his kindred brooks a numerous throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condole his loss, and bring their urns along:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one was wanting of the watery train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That filled his flood, or mingled with the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Inachus, who, in his cave alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept not another's losses, but his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his dear Io, whether strayed, or dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him uncertain, doubtful tears he shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought her through the world, but sought in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no where finding, rather feared her slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her, just returning from her father's brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove had beheld with a desiring look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, oh, fair daughter of the flood, he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy alone of Jove's imperial bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy whoever shall those charms possess!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king of gods, (nor is thy lover less,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invites thee to yon cooler shades, to shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scorching rays of the meridian sun.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone without a guide; thy guide is Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No puny power, but he, whose high command  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Is unconfined, who rules the seas and land,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And tempers thunder in his awful hand.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Oh fly not!&mdash;for she fled from his embrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Lerna's pastures; he pursued the chace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the shades of the Lyrc&aelig;an plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the god, who never asks in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved with vapours, imitating night,                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Both air and earth; and then suppressed her flight,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, mingling force with love, enjoyed the full delight.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the jealous Juno, from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surveyed the fruitful fields of Arcady;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondered that the mist should over-run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of day-light, and obscure the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No natural cause she found, from brooks or bogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or marshy lowlands, to produce the fogs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then round the skies she sought for Jupiter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faithless husband; but no Jove was there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspecting now the worst,&mdash;Or I, she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am much mistaken, or am much betrayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury she precipitates her flight,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Dispels the shadows of dissembled night, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And to the day restores his native light.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The almighty lecher, careful to prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consequence, foreseeing her descent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transforms his mistress in a trice; and now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Io's place, appears a lovely cow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sleek her skin, so faultless was her make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Juno did unwilling pleasure take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see so fair a rival of her love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what she was, and whence, enquired of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what fair herd, and from what pedigree?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god, half-caught, was forced upon a lie,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And said she sprung from earth. She took the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begged the beauteous heifer of her lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should he do? 'twas equal shame to Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to relinquish, or betray his love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to refuse so slight a gift, would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But more to increase his consort's jealousy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fear, and love, by turns his heart assailed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stronger love had sure at length prevailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some faint hope remained, his jealous queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not the mistress through the heifer seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cautious goddess, of her gift possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet harboured anxious thoughts within her breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she, who knew the falsehood of her Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And justly feared some new relapse of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to prevent, and to secure her care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trusty Argus she commits the fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The head of Argus (as with stars the skies,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was compassed round, and wore an hundred eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But two by turns their lids in slumber steep;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The rest on duty still their station keep;   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the total constellation sleep.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, ever present to his eyes and mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His charge was still before him, though behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fields he suffered her to feed by day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when the setting sun to night gave way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captive cow he summoned with a call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drove her back, and tied her to the stall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On leaves of trees and bitter herbs she fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven was her canopy, bare earth her bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hardly lodged; and, to digest her food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drank from troubled streams, defiled with mud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her woeful story fain she would have told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands upheld, but had no hands to hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head to her ungentle keeper bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She strove to speak; she spoke not, but she lowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affrighted with the noise, she looked around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to inquire the author of the sound.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Once on the banks where often she had played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Her father's banks,) she came, and there surveyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her altered visage, and her branching head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starting from herself, she would have fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fellow-nymphs, familiar to her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, but knew her not in this disguise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Inachus himself was ignorant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his daughter, did his daughter want.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She followed where her fellows went, as she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were still a partner of the company:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stroke her neck; the gentle heifer stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her neck offers to their stroking hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her father gave her grass; the grass she took,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And licked his palms, and cast a piteous look,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in the language of her eyes she spoke.    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">She would have told her name, and asked relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, wanting words, in tears she tells her grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which with her foot she makes him understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prints the name of Io in the sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah wretched me! her mournful father cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, with a sigh, to "wretched me!" replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her milk-white neck his arms he threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wept, and then these tender words ensue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And art thou she, whom I have sought around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world, and have at length so sadly found?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So found, is worse than lost: with mutual words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou answerest not, no voice thy tongue affords;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speech, denied, by lowing is expressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknowing, I prepared thy bridal bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With empty hopes of happy issue fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the husband of a herd must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mate, and bellowing sons thy progeny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, were I mortal, death might bring relief!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now my godhead but extends my grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prolongs my woes, of which no end I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes me curse my immortality.&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<span class="i0">More had he said, but fearful of her stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starry guardian drove his charge away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some fresh pasture; on a hilly height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat himself, and kept her still in sight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But shame repressed his rage: the daunted youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon seeks his mother, and enquires the truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, said he, this infamy was thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Epaphus on you, and me your son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke in public, told it to my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor durst I vindicate the dire disgrace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even I, the bold, the sensible of wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restrained by shame, was forced to hold my tongue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear an open slander, is a curse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not to find an answer, is a worse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I am heaven-begot, assert your son        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By some sure sign, and make my father known, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To right my honour, and redeem your own.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and, saying, cast his arms about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her neck, and begged her to resolve the doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis hard to judge if Climen&eacute; were moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More by his prayer, whom she so dearly loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or more with fury fired, to find her name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traduced, and made the sport of common fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stretched her arms to heaven, and fixed her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that fair planet that adorns the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by those beams, said she, whose holy fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consume my breast, and kindle my desires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By him who sees us both, and cheers our sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By him, the public minister of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I swear that Sun begot thee; if I lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him his cheerful influence deny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him no more this perjured creature see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shine on all the world but only me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If still you doubt your mother's innocence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eastern mansion is not far from hence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little pains you to his levee go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from himself your parentage may know.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy the ambitious youth his mother heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, eager for the journey, soon prepared.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He longs the world beneath him to survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guide the chariot, and to give the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Meroe's burning sands he bends his course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor less in India feels his father's force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His travel urging, till he came in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw the palace by the purple light.<br /></span>

<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>Ovid, having told how Theseus had freed Athens from the tribute
of children, which was imposed on them by Minos king of Crete,
by killing the Minotaur, here makes a digression to the story of
Meleager and Atalanta, which is one of the most inartificial connections
in all the Metamorphoses; for he only says, that Theseus
obtained such honour from that combat, that all Greece had recourse
to him in their necessities; and, amongst others, Calydon,
though the hero of that country, prince Meleager, was then living.</i></p>

<span class="i0">From him the Caledonians sought relief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though valiant Meleagrus was their chief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause, a boar, who ravaged far and near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cynthia's wrath, the avenging minister.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Oenius with autumnal plenty blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By gifts to heaven his gratitude expressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Culled sheafs, to Ceres; to Ly&aelig;us, wine; <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To Pan and Pales, offered sheep and kine;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And fat of olives to Minerva's shrine.   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beginning from the rural gods, his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was liberal to the powers of high command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each deity in every kind was blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at Diana's fane the invidious honour ceased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrath touches even the gods; the Queen of Night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired with disdain, and jealous of her right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhonoured though I am, at least, said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not unrevenged that impious act shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift as the word, she sped the boar away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With charge on those devoted fields to prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No larger bulls the Egyptian pastures feed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none so large Sicilian meadows breed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eye-balls glare with fire, suffused with blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His neck shoots up a thick-set thorny wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bristled back a trench impaled appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stands erected, like a field of spears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Froth fills his chaps, he sends a grunting sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And part he churns, and part befoams the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tusks with Indian elephants he strove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jove's own thunder from his mouth he drove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He burns the leaves; the scorching blast invades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender corn, and shrivels up the blades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, suffering not their yellow beards to rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tramples down the spikes, and intercepts the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the barns expect their promised load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor barns at home, nor ricks are heaped abroad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the hinds the threshing-floor prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exercise their flails in empty air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With olives ever green the ground is strowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grapes ungathered shed their generous blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the fold he rages, nor the sheep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shepherds, nor the grooms their bulls, can keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From fields to walls the frighted rabble run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor think themselves secure within the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Melegarus, and his chosen crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contemn the danger, and the praise pursue.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fair Leda's twins, (in time to stars decreed,)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who manned the foremost ship that sailed the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Theseus, joined with bold Pirithous, came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single concord in a double name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thestian sons, Idas, who swiftly ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ceneus, once a woman, now a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lynceus, with eagle's eyes, and lion's heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leucippus, with his never-erring dart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acastus, Phileus, Ph&oelig;nix, Telamon,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Echion, Lelex, and Eurytion,            <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles' father, and great Phocus' son;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">Mopsus the sage, who future things foretold;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">A thousand others of immortal fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the rest, fair Atalanta came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grace of the woods: a diamond buckle bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her vest behind, that else had flow'd upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shew'd her buskin'd legs; her head was bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for her native ornament of hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in a simple knot was tied above,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet negligence, unheeded bait of love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sounding quiver on her shoulder tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One hand a dart, and one a bow supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was her face, as in a nymph displayed<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A fair fierce boy, or in a boy betrayed   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The blushing beauties of a modest maid.   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The Caledonian chief at once the dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, at once his heart received the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heavens averse. O happy youth, he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom thy fates reserve so fair a bribe!<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He sighed, and had no leisure more to say;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His honour called his eyes another way,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And force him to pursue the now neglected prey.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">There stood a forest on the mountain's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which overlooked the shaded plains below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sounding axe presumed those trees to bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coeval with the world, a venerable sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heroes there arrived, some spread around       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The toils, some search the footsteps on the ground,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some from the chains the faithful dogs unbound.    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of action eager, and intent on thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chiefs their honourable danger sought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A valley stood below; the common drain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waters from above, and falling rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bottom was a moist and marshy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose edges were with bending osiers crowned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knotty bulrush next in order stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all within, of reeds a trembling wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From hence the boar was roused, and sprung amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like lightning sudden on the warrior-train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beats down the trees before him, shakes the ground,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The forest echoes to the crackling sound;          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shout the fierce youth, and clamours ring around.  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All stood with their protended spears prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With broad steel heads the brandished weapons glared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beast impetuous with his tusks aside       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Deals glancing wounds; the fearful dogs divide;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All spend their mouth aloft, but none abide.   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Echion threw the first, but missed his mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stuck his boar-spear on a maple's bark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Jason; and his javelin seemed to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But failed with over-force, and whizzed above his back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mopsus was next; but, ere he threw, addressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ph&oelig;bus thus: O patron, help thy priest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I adore, and ever have adored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy power divine, thy present aid afford,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That I may reach the beast!&mdash;The god allowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His prayer, and, smiling, gave him what he could:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reached the savage, but no blood he drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dian unarmed the javelin as it flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This chafed the boar, his nostrils flames expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his red eye-balls roll with living fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirled from a sling, or from an engine thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the foes so flies a mighty stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As flew the beast: the left wing put to flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chiefs o'erborne, he rushes on the right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empalamos and Pelagon he laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dust, and next to death, but for their fellows' aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onesimus fared worse, prepared to fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal fang drove deep within his thigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cut the nerves; the nerves no more sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bulk; the bulk unprop'd, falls headlong on the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nestor had failed the fall of Troy to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, leaning on his lance, he vaulted on a tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, gathering up his feet, looked down with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought his monstrous foe was still too near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against a stump his tusk the monster grinds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the sharpened edge new vigour finds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, trusting to his arms, young Othrys found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ranched his hips with one continued wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Leda's twins, the future stars, appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White were their habits, white their horses were;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conspicuous both, and both in act to throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their trembling lances brandished at the foe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor had they missed; but he to thickets fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concealed from aiming spears, not pervious to the steed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Telamon rushed in, and happed to meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rising root, that held his fastened feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So down he fell, whom, sprawling on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brother from the wooden gyves unbound.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the virgin-huntress was not slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To expel the shaft from her contracted bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his ear the fastened arrow stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the wound appeared the trickling blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She blushed for joy: But Meleagrus raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice with loud applause, and the fair archer praised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was the first to see, and first to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His friends the marks of the successful blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall thy valour want the praises due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said;&mdash;a virtuous envy seized the crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shout; the shouting animates their hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once employ their thronging darts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But out of order thrown, in air they join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And multitude makes frustrate the design.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With both his hands the proud Anc&aelig;us takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flourishes his double biting axe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then forward to his fate, he took a stride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the rest, and to his fellows cried,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give place, and mark the difference, if you can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between a woman-warrior and a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boar is doomed; nor, though Diana lend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her aid, Diana can her beast defend.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus boasted he; then stretched, on tiptoe stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure to make his empty promise good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the more wary beast prevents the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upward rips the groin of his audacious foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anc&aelig;us falls; his bowels from the wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush out, and clotted blood distains the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pirithous, no small portion of the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pressed on, and shook his lance; to whom from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Theseus cried: O stay, my better part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My more than mistress; of my heart, the heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong may fight aloof: Anc&aelig;us tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His force too near, and by presuming died.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and, while he spake, his javelin threw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissing in air, the unerring weapon flew;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But on an arm of oak, that stood betwixt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marksman and the mark, his lance he fixt.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once more bold Jason threw, but failed to wound   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The boar, and slew an undeserving hound;          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And through the dog the dart was nailed to ground.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Two spears from Meleager's hand were sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With equal force, but various in the event;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first was fixed in earth, the second stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the boar's bristled back, and deeply drank his blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, while the tortured savage turns around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flings about his foam, impatient of the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wound's great author, close at hand, provokes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rage, and plies him with redoubled strokes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheels as he wheels, and with his pointed dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explores the nearest passage to his heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick, and more quick, he spins in giddy gyres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then falls, and in much foam his soul expires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This act with shouts heaven high the friendly band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Applaud, and strain in theirs the victor's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all approach the slain with vast surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admire on what a breadth of earth he lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, scarce secure, reach out their spears afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blood their points, to prove their partnership of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he, the conquering chief, his foot impressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the strong neck of that destructive beast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazing on the nymph with ardent eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept, said he, fair Nonacrine, my prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though inferior, suffer me to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My labours, and my part of praise, with thine.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this presents her with the tusky head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chine, with rising bristles roughly spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad, she received the gift; and seemed to take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With double pleasure, for the giver's sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest were seized with sullen discontent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a deaf murmur through the squadron went:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<span class="i0">All envied; but the Thestyan brethren showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The least respect, and thus they vent their spleen aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay down those honoured spoils, nor think to share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weak woman as thou art, the prize of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ours is the title, thine a foreign claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Meleagrus from our lineage came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust not thy beauty; but restore the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he, besotted on that face and eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would rend from us.&mdash;At this, inflamed with spite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her they snatch the gift, from him the giver's right.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soon the impatient prince his faulchion drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried,&mdash;Ye robbers of another's due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now learn the difference, at your proper cost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt true valour, and an empty boast.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this advanced, and, sudden as the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In proud Plexippus' bosom plunged the sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toxeus amazed, and with amazement slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to revenge, or ward the coming blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood doubting; and, while doubting thus he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received the steel bathed in his brother's blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pleased with the first, unknown the second news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alth&aelig;a to the temples pays their dues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her son's conquest; when at length appear    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her grisly brethren stretched upon the bier:     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, at the sudden sight, she changed her cheer,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And with her cheer her robes; but hearing tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause, the manner, and by whom they fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas grief no more, or grief and rage were one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her soul; at last 'twas rage alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which burning upwards, in succession dries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears that stood considering in her eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There lay a log unlighted on the earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she was labouring in the throes of birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the unborn chief, the Fatal Sisters came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised it up, and tossed it on the flame;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the rock a scanty measure place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vital flax, and turned the wheel apace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turning sung,&mdash;To this red brand and thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O new-born babe, we give an equal destiny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So vanished out of view. The frighted dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprung hasty from her bed, and quenched the flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The log, in secret locked, she kept with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that, while thus preserved, preserved her heir.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This brand she now produced; and first she strows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hearth with heaps of chips, and after blows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice heaved her hand, and heaved, she thrice repressed;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The sister and the mother long contest,                  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Two doubtful titles in one tender breast;                <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And now her eyes and cheeks with fury glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now pale her cheeks, her eyes with pity flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now lowring looks presage approaching storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now prevailing love her face reforms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved, she doubts again; the tears, she dried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blushing rage, are by new tears supplied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as a ship, which winds and waves assail,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Now with the current drives, now with the gale,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Both opposite, and neither long prevail,       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">She feels a double force; by turns obeys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The imperious tempest, and the impetuous seas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fares Alth&aelig;a's mind; first she relents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pity, of that pity then repents:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sister and mother long the scales divide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the beam nodded on the sister's side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes she softly sighed, then roared aloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sighs were stifled in the cries of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pious impious wretch at length decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please her brothers' ghosts, her son should bleed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the funeral flames began to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive, she said, a sister's sacrifice;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A mother's bowels burn:&mdash;high in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while she spoke, she held the fatal brand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thrice before the kindled pile she bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the three Furies thrice invoked aloud:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, come, revenging sisters, come and view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sister paying her dead brothers' due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crime I punish, and a crime commit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But blood for blood, and death for death, is fit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great crimes must be with greater crimes repaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And second funerals on the former laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the whole household in one ruin fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may Diana's curse o'ertake us all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fate to happy &OElig;neus still allow       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">One son, while Thestius stands deprived of two?<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Better three lost, than one unpunished go.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Take then, dear ghosts, (while yet, admitted new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hell, you wait my duty,) take your due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A costly offering on your tomb is laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with my blood the price of yours is paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah! whither am I hurried? Ah! forgive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shades, and let your sister's issue live:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mother cannot give him death; though he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves it, he deserves it not from me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then shall the unpunished wretch insult the slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant live? not only live, but reign?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While you, thin shades, the sport of winds, are tost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er dreary plains, or tread the burning coast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot, cannot bear; 'tis past, 'tis done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perish this impious, this detested son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perish his sire, and perish I withal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the houses heir, and the hoped kingdom fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where is the mother fled, her pious love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the pains with which ten months I strove!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! hadst thou died, my son, in infant years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy little hearse hadst been bedewed with tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou livest by me; to me thy breath resign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine is the merit, the demerit thine.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thy life by double title I require;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once given at birth, and once preserved from fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One murder pay, or add one murder more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me to them who fell by thee restore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I would, but cannot: my son's image stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my sight;&mdash;and now their angry hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers hold, and vengeance these exact;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pleads compassion, and repents the fact.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He pleads in vain, and I pronounce his doom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers, though unjustly, shall o'ercome;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But having paid their injured ghosts their due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son requires my death, and mine shall his pursue.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At this, for the last time, she lifts her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Averts her eyes, and half-unwilling drops the brand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brand, amid the flaming fuel thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drew, or seemed to draw, a dying groan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fires themselves but faintly licked their prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then loathed their impious food, and would have shrunk away.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just then the hero cast a doleful cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in those absent flames began to fry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blind contagion raged within his veins;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he, with manly patience, bore his pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feared not fate, but only grieved to die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without an honest wound, and by a death so dry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy Anc&aelig;us, thrice aloud he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what becoming fate in arms he died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then called his brothers, sisters, sire, around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her to whom his nuptial vows were bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps his mother; a long sigh he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, his voice failing, took his last adieu;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as the flames augment, and as they stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At their full height, then languish to decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rise, and sink by fits; at last they soar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one bright blaze, and then descend no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so his inward heats, at height, impair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the last burning breath shoots out the soul in air.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Matrons and maidens beat their breasts, and tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their habits, and root up their scattered hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretched father, father now no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow sunk, lies prostrate on the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deforms his hoary locks with dust obscene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curses age, and loathes a life prolonged with pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By steel her stubborn soul his mother freed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And punished on herself her impious deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I an hundred tongues, a wit so large<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As could their hundred offices discharge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Ph&oelig;bus all his Helicon bestowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the streams inspiring all the god;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those tongues, that wit, those streams, that god in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would offer to describe his sisters' pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They beat their breasts with many a bruising blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they turn livid, and corrupt the snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corps they cherish, while the corps remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exercise and rub with fruitless pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when to funeral flames 'tis borne away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They kiss the bed on which the body lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when those funeral flames no longer burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dust composed within a pious urn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in that urn their brother they confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hug it in their arms, and to their bosoms press.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His tomb is raised; then, stretched along the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those living monuments his tomb surround;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to his name, inscribed, their tears they pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till tears and kisses wear his name away.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Cynthia now had all her fury spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not with less ruin, than a race, content;<br /></span>

<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>The author, pursuing the deeds of Theseus, relates how he, with his
friend Pirithous, were invited by Achelous, the River-God, to
stay with him, till his waters were abated. Achelous entertains
them with a relation of his own love to Perimele, who was changed
into an island by Neptune, at his request. Pirithous, being
an Atheist, derides the legend, and denies the power of the Gods
to work that miracle. Lelex, another companion of Theseus, to
confirm the story of Achelous, relates another metamorphosis, of
Baucis and Philemon into trees; of which he was partly an eyewitness.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus Achelous ends; his audience hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With admiration, and, admiring, fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The powers of heaven; except Ixion's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who laughed at all the gods, believed in none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shook his impious head, and thus replies,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These legends are no more than pious lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You attribute too much to heavenly sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think they give us forms, and take away.&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, of better minds, their sense declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against this doctrine, and with horror heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Lelex rose, an old experienced man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus with sober gravity began;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's power is infinite; earth, air, and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The manufacture mass, the making power obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By proof to clear your doubt;&mdash;In Phrygian ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two neighbouring trees, with walls encompassed round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand on a moderate rise, with wonder shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One a hard oak, a softer linden one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the place and them, by Pittheus sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Phrygian realms, my grandsire's government.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far from thence is seen a lake, the haunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of coots, and of the fishing cormorant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Jove with Hermes came; but in disguise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal men concealed their deities;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One laid aside his thunder, one his rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many toilsome steps together trod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For harbour at a thousand doors they knocked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one of all the thousand but was locked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last an hospitable house they found,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A homely shed; the roof, not far from ground,    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Was thatched with reeds and straw together bound.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">There Baucis and Philemon lived, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lived long married, and a happy pair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now old in love; though little was their store,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Inured to want, their poverty they bore,       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aimed at wealth, professing to be poor.    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For master or for servant here to call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all alike, where only two were all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Command was none, where equal love was paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather both commanded, both obeyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From lofty roofs the gods repulsed before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now stooping, entered through the little door;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The man their hearty welcome first expressed,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A common settle<a id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> drew for either guest,    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Inviting each his weary limbs to rest.       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, ere they sat, officious Baucis lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two cushions stuffed with straw, the seat to raise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coarse, but the best she had; then takes the load<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ashes from the hearth, and spreads abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living coals, and, lest they should expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With leaves and barks she feeds her infant-fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It smokes, and then with trembling breath she blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till in a cheerful blaze the flames arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brushwood and with chips she strengthens these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And adds at last the boughs of rotten trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire thus formed, she sets the kettle on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like burnished gold the little seether shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next took the coleworts which her husband got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his own ground, a small well-watered spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stripped the stalks of all their leaves; the best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She culled, and then with handy care she dressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er the hearth a chine of bacon hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good old Philemon seized it with a prong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the sooty rafter drew it down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cut a slice, but scarce enough for one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet a large portion of a little store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, for their sake alone, he wished were more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This in the pot he plunged without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tame the flesh, and drain the salt away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time between, before the fire they sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shortened the delay by pleasing chat.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
<span class="i2">A beam there was, on which a beechen pail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung by the handle, on a driven nail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This filled with water, gently warmed, they set     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Before their guests; in this they bathed their feet,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And after with clean towels dried their sweat:      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">This done, the host produced the genial bed,<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sallow the foot, the borders, and the sted, <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which with no costly coverlet they spread,  <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But coarse old garments; yet such robes as these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laid alone, at feasts, on holidays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good old housewife, tucking up her gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The table sets; the invited gods lie down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trivet-table of a foot was lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blot which prudent Baucis overcame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thrust beneath the limping leg a sherd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was the mended board exactly reared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rubbed it o'er with newly gathered mint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wholesome herb, that breathed a grateful scent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas<a id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> began the feast, where first was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The party-coloured olive, black and green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Autumnal cornels next in order served,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lees of wine well pickled and preserved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A garden-sallad was the third supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of endive, radishes, and succory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then curds and cream, the flower of country fare,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And new-laid eggs, which Baucis' busy care       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Turned by a gentle fire, and roasted rare.       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All these in earthen-ware were served to board;  <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, next in place, an earthen pitcher, stored   <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With liquor of the best the cottage could afford.<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">This was the table's ornament and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With figures wrought; like pages at his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood beechen bowls; and these were shining clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Varnished with wax without, and lined within.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By this the boiling kettle had prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the table sent the smoking lard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which, with eager appetite, they dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A savoury bit, that served to relish wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine itself was suiting to the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still working in the must, and lately pressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second course succeeds like that before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plumbs, apples, nuts, and, of their wintry-store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry figs and grapes, and wrinkled dates were set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In canisters, to enlarge the little treat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these a milk-white honey-comb surround,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in the midst the country-banquet crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the kind hosts their entertainment grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hearty welcome, and an open face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all they did, you might discern with ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A willing mind, and a desire to please.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mean time the beechen bowls went round, and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though often emptied, were observed to fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled without hands, and of their own accord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran without feet, and danced about the board.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devotion seized the pair, to see the feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wine, and of no common grape, increased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up they held their hands, and fell to prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excusing, as they could, their country fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One goose they had, 'twas all they could allow,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A wakeful sentry, and on duty now,             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whom to the gods for sacrifice they vow:       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her, with malicious zeal, the couple viewed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ran for life, and, limping, they pursued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well the fowl perceived their bad intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would not make her master's compliment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, persecuted, to the powers she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close between the legs of Jove she lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, with a gracious ear, the suppliant heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saved her life; then what he was declared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And owned the god. The neighbourhood, said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall justly perish for impiety;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You stand alone exempted; but obey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With speed, and follow where we lead the way;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Leave these accursed, and to the mountain's height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascend, nor once look backward in your flight.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They haste, and what their tardy feet denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trusty staff (their better leg) supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An arrow's flight they wanted to the top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there secure, but spent with travel, stop;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turn their now no more forbidden eyes:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost in a lake, the floated level lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A watery desert covers all the plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cot alone, as in an isle, remains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering, with peeping eyes, while they deplore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their neighbours' fate, and country now no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their little shed, scarce large enough for two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems, from the ground increased, in height and bulk to grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stately temple shoots within the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crotchets of their cot in columns rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pavement polished marble they behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates with sculpture graced, the spires and tiles of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then thus the sire of gods, with looks serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak thy desire, thou only just of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, O woman, only worthy found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be with such a man in marriage bound.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Awhile they whisper; then, to Jove addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Philemon thus prefers their joint request:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We crave to serve before your sacred shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offer at your altars rites divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since not any action of our life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been polluted with domestic strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We beg one hour of death; that neither she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With widow's tears, may live to bury me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor weeping I, with withered arms, may bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My breathless Baucis to the sepulchre.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The godheads sign their suit. They run their race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same tenour all the appointed space;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when their hour was come, while they relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These past adventures at the temple-gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Baucis is by old Philemon seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprouting with sudden leaves of sprightly green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Baucis looked where old Philemon stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw his lengthened arms a sprouting wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New roots their fastened feet begin to bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bodies stiffen in a rising rind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, ere the bark above their shoulders grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They give and take at once their last adieu;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once, farewell, O faithful spouse, they said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the encroaching rinds their closing lips invade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even yet, an ancient Tyan&aelig;an shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spreading oak, that near a linden grows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neighbourhood confirm the prodigy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave men, not vain of tongue, or like to lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw myself the garlands on their boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tablets hung for gifts of granted vows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offering fresher up, with pious prayer,            <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The good, said I, are God's peculiar care,             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And such as honour heaven, shall heavenly honour share.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">As loud report the miracle resounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Ph&aelig;stus dwelt a man of honest blood,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But meanly born, and not so rich as good,         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Esteemed and loved by all the neighbourhood;      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who to his wife, before the time assigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For child-birth came, thus bluntly spoke his mind:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If heaven, said Lygdus, will vouchsafe to hear,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I have but two petitions to prefer;               <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Short pains for thee, for me a son and heir.      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">Weak puling things, unable to sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their share of labour, and their bread to gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, therefore, thou a creature shalt produce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of so great charges, and so little use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear witness, heaven, with what reluctancy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hapless innocence I doom to die.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and tears the common grief display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him who bade, and her who must obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet Telethusa still persists, to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit arguments to move a father's mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To extend his wishes to a larger scope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in one vessel not confine his hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lygdus continues hard; her time drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she her heavy load could scarcely bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When slumbering, in the latter shades of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the approaches of returning light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw, or thought she saw, before her bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious train, and Isis at their head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her moony horns were on her forehead placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yellow sheaves her shining temples graced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mitre, for a crown, she wore on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog, and dappled bull, were waiting by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Osiris, sought along the banks of Nile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent god; the sacred Crocodile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, last, a long procession moving on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With timbrels, that assist the labouring moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her slumbers seemed dispelled, and, broad awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard a voice, that thus distinctly spake:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My votary, thy babe from death defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fear to save whate'er the gods will send;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delude with art thy husband's dire decree;                <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When danger calls, repose thy trust on me;                <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And know, thou hast not served a thankless deity.&mdash;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">This promise made, with night the goddess fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy the woman wakes, and leaves her bed;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And prays the powers their gift to ratify.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Now grinding pains proceed to bearing throes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till its own weight the burden did disclose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas of the beauteous kind, and brought to light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With secrecy, to shun the father's sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The indulgent mother did her care employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed it on her husband for a boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nurse was conscious of the fact alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father paid his vows as for a son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called him Iphis, by a common name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which either sex with equal right may claim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iphis his grandsire was; the wife was pleased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of half the fraud by fortune's favour eased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doubtful name was used without deceit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And truth was covered with a pious cheat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The habit showed a boy, the beauteous face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With manly fierceness mingled female grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now thirteen years of age were swiftly run,      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When the fond father thought the time drew on    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of settling in the world his only son.           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ianthe was his choice; so wondrous fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her form alone with Iphis could compare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A neighbour's daughter of his own degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not more blessed with Fortune's goods than he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They soon espoused; for they with ease were joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who were before contracted in the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their age the same, their inclinations too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bred together in one school, they grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, fatally disposed to mutual fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They felt, before they knew, the same desires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal their flame, unequal was their care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One loved with hope, one languished in despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid accused the lingering days alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom she thought a man, she thought her own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Iphis bends beneath a greater grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fiercely burns, but hopes for no relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en her despair adds fuel to her fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid with madness does a maid desire.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, scarce refraining tears, Alas, said she,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With what prodigious flames am I possest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could I the care of Providence deserve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven must destroy me, if it would preserve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that's my fate, or sure it would have sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some usual evil for my punishment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not this unkindly curse; to rage and burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where nature shews no prospect of return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cows for cows consume with fruitless fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mares, when hot, their fellow-mares desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father of the fold supplies his ewes;                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The stag through secret woods his hind pursues;           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">Her females nature guards from female flame,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">The daughter of the Sun a bull desired;<a id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet e'en then a male a female fired:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But mine is much the madder of the two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To things impossible she was not bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But found the means to compass her intent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cheat his eyes she took a different shape;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still she gained a lover, and a leap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should all the wit of all the world conspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should D&aelig;dalus assist my wild desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What art can make me able to enjoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what can change Ianthe to a boy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extinguish then thy passion, hopeless maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And recollect thy reason for thy aid.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Know what thou art, and love as maidens ought,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thou canst not hope thy fond desires to gain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No jealous husband hinders our desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My parents are propitious to my wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she herself consenting to the bliss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things concur to prosper our design;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things to prosper any love but mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I never can enjoy the fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis past the power of heaven to grant my prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven has been kind, as far as heaven can be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our parents with our own desires agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nature, stronger than the gods above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuses her assistance to my love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sets the bar that causes all my pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One gift refused makes all their bounty vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the happy day is just at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bind our hearts in Hymen's holy band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts, but not our bodies; thus accursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In midst of water I complain of thirst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why comest thou, Juno, to these barren rites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bless a bed defrauded of delights?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why should Hymen lift his torch on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see two brides in cold embraces lie?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus love-sick Iphis her vain passion mourns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With equal ardour fair Ianthe burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invoking Hymen's name, and Juno's power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speed the work, and haste the happy hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She hopes, while Telethusa fears the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strives to interpose some new delay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now feigns a sickness, now is in a fright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this bad omen, or that boding sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But having done whate'er she could devise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emptied all her magazine of lies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The time approached; the next ensuing day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Trembling with fear, great Isis they adored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embraced her altar, and her aid implored.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fair queen, who dost on fruitful Egypt smile,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who sway'st the sceptre of the Pharian isle,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sevenfold falls of disemboguing Nile;      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Relieve, in this our last distress, she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A suppliant mother, and a mournful maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, goddess, thou wert present to my sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revealed I saw thee by thy own fair light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw thee in my dream, as now I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all thy marks of awful majesty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious train that compassed thee around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the hollow timbrel's holy sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy words I noted, which I still retain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not thy sacred oracles be vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Iphis lives, that I myself am free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From shame and punishment, I owe to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On thy protection all our hopes depend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy counsel saved us, let thy power defend.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her tears pursued her words, and, while she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goddess nodded, and her altar shook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple doors, as with a blast of wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were heard to clap; the lunar horns, that bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brows of Isis, cast a blaze around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling timbrel made a murmuring sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some hopes these happy omens did impart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth went the mother with a beating heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not much in fear, nor fully satisfied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Iphis followed with a larger stride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whiteness of her skin forsook her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her looks emboldened with an awful grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her features and her strength together grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her long hair to curling locks withdrew.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her sparkling eyes with manly vigour shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big was her voice, audacious was her tone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The latent parts, at length revealed, began<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The maid becomes a youth;&mdash;no more delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your vows, but look, and confidently pay.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gifts the parents to the temple bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The votive tables this inscription wear;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iphis, the man, has to the goddess paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vows, that Iphis offered when a maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now when the star of day had shown his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus and Juno with their presence grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nuptial rites, and Hymen from above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descended to complete their happy love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods of marriage lend their mutual aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the warm youth enjoys the lovely maid.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well pleased to want a consort of his bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sculpture exercised his happy skill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carved in ivory such a maid, so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As nature could not with his art compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were she to work; but in her own defence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must take her pattern here, and copy hence.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with his idol, he commends, admires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adores; and last, the thing adored desires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A very virgin in her face was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, had she moved, a living maid had been:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One would have thought she could have stirred, but strove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With modesty, and was ashamed to move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art, hid with art, so well performed the cheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It caught the carver with his own deceit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows 'tis madness, yet he must adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the more he knows it, loves the more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired with this thought, at once he strained the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the lips a burning kiss impressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true, the hardened breast resists the gripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold lips return a kiss unripe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when, retiring back, he looked again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think it ivory was a thought too mean;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So would believe she kissed, and courting more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again embraced her naked body o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, straining hard the statue, was afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands had made a dint, and hurt the maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explored her, limb by limb, and feared to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flattery now he seeks her mind to move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now with gifts, the powerful bribes of love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He furnishes her closet first; and fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowded shelves with rarities of shells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds orient pearls, which from the conchs he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the sparkling stones of various hue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And parrots, imitating human tongue,<a id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And singing-birds in silver cages hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every fragrant flower, and odorous green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich fashionable robes her person deck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pendents her ears, and pearls adorn her neck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tapered fingers too with rings are graced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an embroidered zone surrounds her slender waste.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus like a queen arrayed, so richly dressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauteous she showed, but naked showed the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from the floor he raised a royal bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With coverings of Sidonian purple spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The solemn rites performed, he calls her bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blandishments invites her to his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she were with vital sense possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head did on a plumy pillow rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The feast of Venus came, a solemn day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the Cypriots due devotion pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gilded horns the milk-white heifers led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughtered before the sacred altars, bled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pygmalion, offering, first approached the shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then with prayers implored the powers divine;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almighty Gods, if all we mortals want,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all we can require, be yours to grant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make this fair statue mine,&mdash;he would have said, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But changed his words for shame, and only prayed,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Give me the likeness of my ivory maid!&mdash;         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">The golden Goddess, present at the prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well knew he meant the inanimated fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave the sign of granting his desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thrice in cheerful flames ascends the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth, returning to his mistress, hies, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And impudent in hope, with ardent eyes,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And beating breast, by the dear statue lies.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He kisses her white lips, renews the bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looks and thinks they redden at the kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought them warm before: nor longer stays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But next his hand on her hard bosom lays;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Hard as it was, beginning to relent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed the breast beneath his fingers bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt again, his fingers made a print,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the dint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasing task he fails not to renew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft, and more soft at every touch it grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like pliant wax, when chafing hands reduce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The former mass to form, and frame to use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would believe, but yet is still in pain,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And tries his argument of sense again,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Presses the pulse, and feels the leaping vein.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Convinced, o'erjoyed, his studied thanks and praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her who made the miracle, he pays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lips to lips he joined; now freed from fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He found the savour of the kiss sincere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this the wakened image oped her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And viewed at once the light and lover with surprise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goddess, present at the match she made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So blessed the bed, such fruitfulness conveyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ere ten moons had sharpened either horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown their bliss, a lovely boy was born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paphos his name, who, grown to manhood, walled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city Paphos, from the founder called.<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Since nature could behold so dire a crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gratulate at least my native clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such a land, which such a monster bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far is distant from our Thracian shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Araby extol her happy coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cinnamon and sweet amomum boast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fragrant flowers, her trees with precious tears,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her second harvests, and her double years;               <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">How can the land be called so blessed, that Myrrha bears?<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not all her odorous tears can cleanse her crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her plant alone deforms the happy clime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cupid denies to have inflamed thy heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disowns thy love, and vindicates his dart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some fury gave thee those infernal pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shot her venomed vipers in thy veins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hate thy sire, had merited a curse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such an impious love deserved a worse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neighbouring monarchs, by thy beauty led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contend in crowds, ambitious of thy bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world is at thy choice, except but one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except but him thou canst not choose alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knew it too, the miserable maid,             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ere impious love her better thoughts betrayed,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And thus within her secret soul she said:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Myrrha! whither would thy wishes tend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye Gods, ye sacred laws, my soul defend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From such a crime as all mankind detest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never lodged before in human breast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is it sin? Or makes my mind alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The imagined sin? For nature makes it none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What tyrant then these envious laws began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made not for any other beast but man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father-bull his daughter may bestride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horse may make his mother-mare a bride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What piety forbids the lusty ram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or more salacious goat, to rut their dam?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All creatures else are of a happier kind,       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whom nor ill-natured laws from pleasure bind,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thoughts of sin disturb their peace of mind.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But man a slave of his own making lives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fool denies himself what nature gives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too busy senates, with an over-care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make us better than our kind can bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have dashed a spice of envy in the laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, straining up too high, have spoiled the cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet some wise nations break their cruel chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And own no laws, but those which love ordains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where happy daughters with their sires are joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piety is doubly paid in kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O that I had been born in such a clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not here, where 'tis the country makes the crime!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whither would my impious fancy stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence hopes, and ye forbidden thoughts, away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His worth deserves to kindle my desires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the love that daughters bear to sires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then had not Cinyras my father been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hindered Myrrha's hopes to be his queen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the perverseness of my fate is such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he's not mine, because he's mine too much:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our kindred-blood debars a better tie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might be nearer, were he not so nigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes and their objects never must unite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some distance is required to help the sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain would I travel to some foreign shore,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Never to see my native country more,      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">So might I to myself myself restore;      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">So might my mind these impious thoughts remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ceasing to behold, might cease to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stay I must, to feed my famished sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk, to kiss; and more, if more I might:...<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More, impious maid! What more canst thou design?<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To make a monstrous mixture in thy line,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And break all statutes human and divine?        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou be called (to save thy wretched life)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mother's rival, and thy father's wife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confound so many sacred names in one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy brother's mother! sister to thy son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear'st thou not to see the infernal bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads with snakes, with torches armed their hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full at thy face the avenging brands to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shake the serpents from their hissing hair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou in time the increasing ill controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor first debauch the body by the soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure the sacred quiet of thy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep the sanctions nature has designed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose I should attempt, the attempt were vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No thoughts like mine his sinless soul profane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observant of the right; and O, that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could cure my madness, or be mad like me!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus she; but Cinyras, who daily sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crowd of noble suitors at his knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among so many, knew not whom to choose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irresolute to grant, or to refuse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, having told their names, inquired of her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who pleased her best, and whom she would prefer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blushing maid stood silent with surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her father fixed her ardent eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking, sighed; and, as she sighed, began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round tears to shed, that scalded as they ran.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender sire, who saw her blush, and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascribed it all to maiden-modesty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dried the falling drops, and, yet more kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stroked her cheeks, and holy kisses joined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felt a secret venom fire her blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found more pleasure than a daughter should;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, asked again, what lover of the crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She liked the best? she answered, one like you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mistaking what she meant, her pious will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He praised, and bade her so continue still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The word of "pious" heard, she blushed with shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of secret guilt, and could not bear the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas now the mid of night, when slumbers close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes, and sooth our cares with soft repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no repose could wretched Myrrha find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her body rolling, as she rolled her mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad with desire, she ruminates her sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wishes all her wishes o'er again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now she despairs, and now resolves to try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would not, and would again, she knows not why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stops and returns, makes and retracts the vow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain would begin, but understands not how:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when a pine is hewn upon the plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the last mortal stroke alone remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labouring in pangs of death, and threatening all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that she nods, considering where to fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Myrrha's mind, impelled on either side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes every bent, but cannot long abide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irresolute on which she should rely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, unfixed in all, is only fixed to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that sad thought she rests; resolved on death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rises, and prepares to choke her breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then while about the beam her zone she ties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear Cinyras, farewell, she softly cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thee I die, and only wish to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not hated, when thou know'st I die for thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pardon the crime, in pity to the cause.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This said, about her neck the noose she draws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nurse, who lay without, her faithful guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though not the words, the murmurs overheard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighs and hollow sounds; surprised with fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She starts, and leaves her bed, and springs a light;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unlocks the door, and, entering out of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dying saw, and instruments of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shrieks, she cuts the zone with trembling haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her arms her fainting charge embraced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next (for she now had leisure for her tears)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She weeping asked, in these her blooming years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What unforeseen misfortune caused her care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To loathe her life, and languish in despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid, with downcast eyes, and mute with grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For death unfinished, and ill-timed relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood sullen to her suit: the beldame pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more to know, and bared her withered breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adjured her, by the kindly food she drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those dry founts, her secret ill to shew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad Myrrha sighed, and turned her eyes aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nurse still urged, and would not be denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor only promised secrecy, but prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She might have leave to give her offered aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good will, she said, my want of strength supplies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And diligence shall give what age denies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If strong desires thy mind to fury move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With charms and medicines I can cure thy love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If envious eyes their hurtful rays have cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More powerful verse shall free thee from the blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If heaven, offended, sends thee this disease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offended heaven with prayers we can appease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then remains, that can these cares procure?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy house is flourishing; thy fortune sure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy careful mother yet in health survives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to thy comfort, thy kind father lives.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The virgin started at her father's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighed profoundly, conscious of the shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the nurse her impious love divined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet surmised, that love disturbed her mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus thinking, she pursued her point, and laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lull'd within her lap the mourning maid;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then softly soothed her thus,&mdash;I guess your grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You love, my child; your love shall find relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My long experienced age shall be your guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rely on that, and lay distrust aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No breath of air shall on the secret blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall (what most you fear) your father know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck once again, as with a thunder-clap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilty virgin bounded from her lap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw her body prostrate on the bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to conceal her blushes, hid her head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There silent lay, and warned her with her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go; but she received not the command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remaining still importunate to know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Myrrha thus; Or ask no more, or go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pr'ythee go, or, staying, spare my shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thou wouldst hear, is impious even to name.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this, on high the beldame holds her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trembling, both with age and terrour, stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adjures, and, falling at her feet, intreats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sooths her with blandishments, and frights with threats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell the crime intended, or disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What part of it she knew, if she no farther knows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last, if conscious to her counsel made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confirms anew the promise of her aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now Myrrha raised her head; but soon, oppressed    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With shame, reclined it on her nurse's breast;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bathed it with tears, and strove to have confessed:<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Twice she began, and stopped; again she tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faultering tongue its office still denied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last her veil before her face she spread,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And drew a long preluding sigh, and said,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">O happy mother, in thy marriage bed!...     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then groaned, and ceased.&mdash;The good old woman shook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff were her eyes, and ghastly was her look;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her hoary hair upright with horror stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made (to her grief) more knowing than she would;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much she reproached, and many things she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cure the madness of the unhappy maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain; for Myrrha stood convict of ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her reason vanquished, but unchanged her will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perverse of mind, unable to reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood resolved or to possess, or die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the fondness of a nurse prevailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against her better sense, and virtue failed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoy, my child, since such is thy desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy love, she said; she durst not say, thy sire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, though unhappy, live on any terms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with a second oath her faith confirms.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The solemn feast of Ceres now was near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When long white linen stoles the matrons wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ranked in procession walk the pious train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offering first-fruits, and spikes of yellow grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nine long nights the nuptial bed they shun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sanctifying harvest, lie alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with the crowd, the queen forsook her lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ceres' power with secret rites adored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal couch now vacant for a time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crafty crone, officious in her crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curst occasion took; the king she found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easy with wine, and deep in pleasure drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared for love; the beldame blew the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confessed the passion, but concealed the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her form she praised; the monarch asked her years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she replied, the same that Myrrha bears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine and commended beauty fired his thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient, he commands her to be brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with her charge performed, she hies her home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gratulates the nymph, the task was overcome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myrrha was joyed the welcome news to hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, clogged with guilt, the joy was insincere<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So various, so discordant is the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in our will, a different will we find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill she presaged, and yet pursued her lust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For guilty pleasures give a double gust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas depth of night; Arctophylax had driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lazy wain half round the northern heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Myrrha hastened to the crime desired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon beheld her first, and first retired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars, amazed, ran backward from the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, shrunk within their sockets, lost their light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius first withdraws his holy flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Virgin sign, in heaven the second name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slides down the belt, and from her station flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night with sable clouds involves the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold Myrrha still pursues her black intent;      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">She stumbled thrice, (an omen of the event;)     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice shrieked the funeral owl, yet on she went,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Secure of shame, because secure of sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even bashful sins are impudent by night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linked hand in hand, the accomplice and the dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their way exploring, to the chamber came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door was ope, they blindly grope their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dark in bed the expecting monarch lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far her courage held, but here forsakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faint knees knock at every step she makes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nearer to her crime, the more within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She feels remorse, and horror of her sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repents too late her criminal desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wishes, that unknown she could retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her, lingering thus, the nurse, who feared delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal secret might at length betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulled forward, to complete the work begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said to Cinyras,&mdash;Receive thy own!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus saying, she delivered kind to kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accursed, and their devoted bodies joined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sire, unknowing of the crime, admits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bowels, and profanes the hallowed sheets.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He found she trembled, but believed she strove,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With maiden modesty, against her love;                    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sought, with flattering words, vain fancies to remove.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps he said, My daughter, cease thy fears,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the title suited with her years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, Father,&mdash;she might whisper him again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That names might not be wanting to the sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of her sire, she left the incestuous bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carried in her womb the crime she bred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another, and another night she came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For frequent sin had left no sense of shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Cinyras desired to see her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose body he had held in close embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought a taper; the revealer, light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exposed both crime, and criminal, to sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief, rage, amazement, could no speech afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the sheath he drew the avenging sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilty fled; the benefit of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That favoured first the sin, secured the flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long wandering through the spacious fields, she bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voyage to the Arabian continent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then passed the region which Panch&aelig;a joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flying left the palmy plains behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine times the moon had mewed her horns; at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With travel weary, unsupplied with strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the burden of her womb oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sab&aelig;an fields afford her needful rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, loathing life, and yet of death afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In anguish of her spirit, thus she prayed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye powers, if any so propitious are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To accept my penitence, and hear my prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your judgments, I confess, are justly sent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great sins deserve as great a punishment:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, since my life the living will profane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since my death the happy dead will stain,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A middle state your mercy may bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the realms above, and those below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some other form to wretched Myrrha give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prayers of penitents are never vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, she did her last request obtain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, while she spoke, the ground began to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathered round her feet, her legs, and thighs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her toes in roots descend, and, spreading wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A firm foundation for the trunk provide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her solid bones convert to solid wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pith her marrow, and to sap her blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her arms are boughs, her fingers change their kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tender skin is hardened into rind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the rising tree her womb invests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, shooting upwards still, invades her breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shades the neck; and, weary with delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sunk her head within, and met it half the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though with outward shape she lost her sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bitter tears she wept her last offence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still she weeps, nor sheds her tears in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For still the precious drops her name retain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mean time the misbegotten infant grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ripe for birth, distends with deadly throes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swelling rind, with unavailing strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave the wooden womb, and pushes into life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother-tree, as if oppressed with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writhes here and there, to break the bark, in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a labouring woman, would have prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wants a voice to call Lucina's aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bending bole sends out a hollow sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trickling tears fall thicker on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mild Lucina came uncalled, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the struggling boughs, and heard the groaning wood;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then reached her midwife-hand, to speed the throes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoke the powerful spells that babes to birth disclose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bark divides, the living load to free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And safe delivers the convulsive tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ready nymphs receive the crying child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wash him in the tears the parent plant distilled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They swathed him with their scarfs; beneath him spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ground with herbs; with roses raised his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovely babe was born with every grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even envy must have praised so fair a face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was his form, as painters, when they show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their utmost art, on naked loves bestow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that their arms no difference might betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give him a bow, or his from Cupid take away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time glides along, with undiscovered haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The future but a length behind the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So swift are years; the babe, whom just before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grandsire got, and whom his sister bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drop, the thing which late the tree inclosed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late the yawning bark to life exposed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A babe, a boy, a beauteous youth appears;<a id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lovelier than himself at riper years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to the queen of love he gave desires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with her pains, revenged his mother's fires.<br /></span>

<p class="center">CONNECTION OF THIS FABLE WITH THE FORMER.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>Ceyx, the son of Lucifer, (the morning star,) and king of Trachin,
in Thessaly, was married to Alcyone, daughter to &AElig;olus, god of
the winds. Both the husband and the wife loved each other with
an entire affection. D&aelig;dalion, the elder brother of Ceyx, whom
he succeeded, having been turned into a falcon by Apollo, and
Chione, D&aelig;dalion's daughter, slain by Diana. Ceyx prepares a
ship to sail to Claros, there to consult the oracle of Apollo, and
(as Ovid seems to intimate) to enquire how the anger of the Gods
might be atoned.</i></p>

<span class="i0">These prodigies affect the pious prince;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, more perplexed with those that happened since,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He purposes to seek the Clarian God,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Avoiding Delphos, his more famed abode;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Since Phlegian robbers made unsafe the road.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet could not he from her he loved so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal voyage, he resolved, conceal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she saw her lord prepared to part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deadly cold ran shivering to her heart;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her faded cheeks are changed to boxen hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her eyes the tears are ever new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thrice essayed to speak; her accents hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, faultering, died unfinished on her tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or vanished into sighs; with long delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice returned; and found the wonted way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, my lord, she said, what fault unknown<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thy once beloved Alcyone has done?            <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whither, ah whither is thy kindness gone!     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Can Ceyx then sustain to leave his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unconcerned forsake the sweets of life?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can thy mind to this long journey move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or need'st thou absence to renew thy love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if thou goest by land, though grief possess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul even then, my fears will be the less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! be warned to shun the watery way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face is frightful of the stormy sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For late I saw a drift disjointed planks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empty tombs erected on the banks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let false hopes to trust betray thy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because my sire in caves constrains the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can with a breath a clamorous rage appease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fear his whistle, and forsake the seas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so; for, once indulged, they sweep the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deaf to the call, or, hearing, hear in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bent on mischief, bear the waves before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, not content with seas, insult the shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ocean, air, and earth, at once engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rooted forests fly before their rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the clashing clouds to battle move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightnings run across the fields above:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know them well, and marked their rude comport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet a child, within my father's court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In times of tempest they command alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he but sits precarious on the throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more I know, the more my fears augment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fears are oft prophetic of the event.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But if not fears, or reasons will prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fate has fixed thee obstinate to sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go not without thy wife, but let me bear<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">My part of danger with an equal share,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And present suffer what I only fear;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then o'er the bounding billows shall we fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure to live together, or to die.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These reasons moved her starlike husband's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still he held his purpose to depart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as he loved her equal to his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not to the seas expose his wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could be wrought his voyage to refrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sought by arguments to sooth her pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor these availed; at length he lights on one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which so difficult a cause he won:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love, so short an absence cease to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, by my father's holy flame I swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before two moons their orb with light adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If heaven allow me life, I will return.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This promise of so short a stay prevails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He soon equips the ship, supplies the sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives the word to launch; she trembling views<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pomp of death, and parting tears renews;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last, with a kiss, she took a long farewell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighed, with a sad presage, and swooning fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Ceyx seeks delays, the lusty crew,              <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Raised on their banks, their oars in order drew       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To their broad breasts,&mdash;the ship with fury flew.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">The queen, recovered, rears her humid eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first her husband on the poop espies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking his hand at distance on the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took the sign, and shook her hand again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still as the ground recedes, retracts her view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sharpened sight, till she no longer knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The much-loved face; that comfort lost, supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With less, and with the galley feeds her eyes;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The galley borne from view by rising gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She followed with her sight the flying sails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When even the flying sails were seen no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaken of all sight, she left the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on her bridal bed her body throws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought in sleep her wearied eyes to close;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband's pillow, and the widowed part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once he pressed, renewed the former smart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now a breeze from shore began to blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sailors ship their oars, and cease to row;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hoist their yards atrip, and all their sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fall, to court the wind, and catch the gales.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this the vessel half her course had run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as much rested till the rising sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both shores were lost to sight, when at the close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of day, a stiffer gale at east arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea grew white, the rolling waves from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like heralds, first denounce the watery war.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This seen, the master soon began to cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike, strike the top-sail; let the main sheet fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And furl your sails.&mdash;The winds repel the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the speaker's mouth the speech is drowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet of their own accord, as danger taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each in his way, officiously they wrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some stow their oars, or stop the leaky sides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another, bolder yet, the yard bestrides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folds the sails; a fourth, with labour, laves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The intruding seas, and waves ejects on waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In this confusion while their work they ply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds augment the winter of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wage intestine wars; the suffering seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are tossed, and mingled as their tyrants please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master would command, but, in despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of safety, stands amazed with stupid care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor what to bid, or what forbid, he knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ungoverned tempest to such fury grows;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Vain is his force, and vainer is his skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such a concourse comes the flood of ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cries of men are mixed with rattling shrouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seas dash on seas, and clouds encounter clouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once from east to west, from pole to pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forky lightnings flash, the roaring thunders roll.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now waves on waves ascending scale the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the fires above, the water fries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When yellow sands are sifted from below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering billows give a golden show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the fouler bottom spews the black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Stygian dye the tainted waters take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then frothy white appear the flatted seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And change their colour, changing their disease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like various fits the Trachin vessel finds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now sublime she rides upon the winds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from a lofty summit looks from high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the clouds beholds the nether sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from the depth of hell they lift their sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at a distance see superior light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lashing billows make a loud report,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beat her sides, as battering rams a fort;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as a lion, bounding in his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With force augmented bears against his prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidelong to seize; or, unappalled with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Springs on the toils, and rushes on the spear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So seas impelled by winds, with added power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assault the sides, and o'er the hatches tower.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The planks, their pitchy coverings washed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now yield; and now a yawning breach display;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roaring waters with a hostile tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush through the ruins of her gaping side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, in sheets of rain the sky descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ocean, swelled with waters, upwards tends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One rising, falling one; the heavens and sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet at their confines, in the middle way;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The sails are drunk with showers, and drop with rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet waters mingle with the briny main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No star appears to lend his friendly light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkness and tempest make a double night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But flashing fires disclose the deep by turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while the lightnings blaze, the water burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now all the waves their scattered force unite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as a soldier, foremost in the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes way for others, and, an host alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still presses on, and, urging, gains the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So while the invading billows come a-breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hero tenth advanced before the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps all before him with impetuous sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the walls descends upon the prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part following enter, part remain without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With envy hear their fellows' conquering shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mount on others' backs, in hope to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city, thus become the seat of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An universal cry resounds aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sailors run in heaps, a helpless crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art fails, and courage falls, no succour near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many waves, as many deaths appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One weeps, and yet despairs of late relief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One cannot weep, his fears congeal his grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, stupid, with dry eyes expects his fate.   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">One with loud shrieks laments his lost estate, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And calls those happy whom their funerals wait.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">This wretch with prayers and vows the gods implores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even the skies he cannot see, adores.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other on his friends his thoughts bestows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His careful father, and his faithful spouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The covetous worldling in his anxious mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinks only on the wealth he left behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All Ceyx his Alcyone employs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her he grieves, yet in her absence joys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife he wishes, and would still be near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not her with him, but wishes him with her:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now with last looks he seeks his native shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which fate has destined him to see no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought, but in the dark tempestuous night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew not whither to direct his sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So whirl the seas, such darkness blinds the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the black night receives a deeper dye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The giddy ship ran round; the tempest tore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mast, and over-board the rudder bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One billow mounts; and with a scornful brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of her conquest gained, insults the waves below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lighter falls, than if some giant tore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pindus and Athos, with the freight they bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tossed on seas; pressed with the ponderous blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down sinks the ship within the abyss below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down with the vessel sink into the main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many, never more to rise again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some few on scattered planks, with fruitless care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay hold, and swim; but, while they swim, despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even he, who late a sceptre did command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now grasps a floating fragment in his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while he struggles on the stormy main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invokes his father, and his wife, in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet his consort is his greater care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alcyone he names amidst his prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Names as a charm against the waves and wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most in his mouth, and ever in his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired with his toil, all hopes of safety past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From prayers to wishes he descends at last,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his dead body, wafted to the sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might have its burial from her friendly hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As oft as he can catch a gulph of air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peep above the seas, he names the fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, even when plunged beneath, on her he raves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring Alcyone below the waves:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At last a falling billow stops his breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks o'er his head, and whelms him underneath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright Lucifer<a id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> unlike himself appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night, his heavenly form obscured with tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since he was forbid to leave the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He muffled with a cloud his mournful eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mean time Alcyone (his fate unknown)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Computes how many nights he had been gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observes the waning moon with hourly view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Numbers her age, and wishes for a new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the promised time provides with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hastens in the woof the robes he was to wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for herself employs another loom,                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">New-dressed to meet her lord returning home,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Flattering her heart with joys that never were to come<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">She fumed the temples with an odorous flame,<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And oft before the sacred altars came,      <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To pray for him, who was an empty name;     <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All powers implored, but far above the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Juno she her pious vows addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her much-loved lord from perils to protect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And safe o'er seas his voyage to direct;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then prayed that she might still possess his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no pretending rival share a part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This last petition heard, of all her prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, dispersed by winds, were lost in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But she, the goddess of the nuptial bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired with her vain devotions for the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved the tainted hand should be repelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which incense offered, and her altar held:<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Haste to the house of Sleep, and bid the god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rules the night by visions with a nod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare a dream, in figure and in form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resembling him who perished in the storm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This form before Alcyone present,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make her certain of the sad event.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Endued with robes of various hue she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flying draws an arch, a segment of the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then leaves her bending bow, and from the steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descends to search the silent house of Sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Near the Cimmerians, in his dark abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in a cavern, dwells the drowsy god;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome noon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lazy vapours round the region fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual twilight, and a doubtful sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No crowing cock does there his wings display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with his horny bill provoke the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor watchful dogs, nor the more wakeful geese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb with nightly noise the sacred peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor beast of nature, nor the tame, are nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor trees with tempests rocked, nor human cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But safe repose, without an air of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An arm of Lethe, with a gentle flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arising upwards from the rock below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palace moats, and o'er the pebbles creeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with soft murmurs calls the coming sleeps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around its entry nodding poppies grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all cool simples that sweet rest bestow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night from the plants their sleepy virtue drains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passing sheds it on the silent plains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No door there was the unguarded house to keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On creaking hinges turned, to break his sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in the gloomy court was raised a bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuffed with black plumes, and on an ebon sted;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Black was the covering too, where lay the god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slept supine, his limbs displayed abroad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his head fantastic visions fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which various images of things supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mock their forms; the leaves on trees not more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor bearded ears in fields, nor sands upon the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The virgin, entering bright, indulged the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the brown cave, and brushed the dreams away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god, disturbed with this new glare of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast sudden on his face, unsealed his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised his tardy head, which sunk again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sinking on his bosom, knocked his chin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length shook off himself, and asked the dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And asking yawned,) for what intent she came?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom the goddess thus:&mdash;O sacred Rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet pleasing Sleep, of all the powers the best!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O peace of mind, repairer of decay,                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whose balms renew the limbs to labours of the day,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Care shuns thy soft approach, and sullen flies away!<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Adorn a dream, expressing human form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shape of him who suffered in the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And send it flitting to the Trachin court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wreck of wretched Ceyx to report:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his queen bid the pale spectre stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who begs a vain relief at Juno's hand.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and scarce awake her eyes could keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to support the fumes of sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fled, returning by the way she went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swerved along her bow with swift ascent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The god, uneasy till he slept again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved at once to rid himself of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though against his custom, called aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exciting Morpheus from the sleepy crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morpheus, of all his numerous train, expressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shape of man, and imitated best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walk, the words, the gesture could supply,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This d&aelig;mon, Icelos, in heaven's high hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods have named; but men Phobeter call:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A third is Phantasus, whose actions roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On meaner thoughts, and things devoid of soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, fruits, and flowers, he represents in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And solid rocks unmoved, and running streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These three to kings and chiefs their scenes display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest before the ignoble commons play:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these the chosen Morpheus is dispatched;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which done, the lazy monarch overwatched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from his propping elbow drops his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolved in sleep, and shrinks within his bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Darkling the d&aelig;mon glides, for flight prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So soft that scarce his fanning wings are heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Trachin, swift as thought, the flitting shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through air his momentary journey made:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lays aside the steerage of his wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsakes his proper form, assumes the king's;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pale as death, despoiled of his array,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Into the queen's apartment takes his way, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And stands before the bed at dawn of day: <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved his eyes, and wet his beard appears,<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And shedding vain, but seeming real tears;  <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The briny water dropping from his hairs;    <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then staring on her, with a ghastly look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hollow voice, he thus the Queen bespoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Knowest thou not me? Not yet, unhappy wife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or are my features perished with my life?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look once again, and for thy husband lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! all that's left of him, thy husband's ghost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy vows for my return were all in vain;       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thy stormy south o'ertook us in the main;      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And never shalt thou see thy loving lord again.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bear witness, heaven, I called on thee in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while I called, a billow stopped my breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think not that flying fame reports my fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, present I, appear, and my own wreck relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise, wretched widow, rise, nor undeplored             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Permit my ghost to pass the Stygian ford;              <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But rise, prepared in black to mourn thy perished lord.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Thus said the player-god; and, adding art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of voice and gesture, so performed his part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought (so like her love the shade appears)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ceyx spake the words, and Ceyx shed the tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She groaned, her inward soul with grief opprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sighed, she wept, and sleeping beat her breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretched her arms to embrace his body bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her clasping arms inclose but empty air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this, not yet awake, she cried,&mdash;Oh stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One is our fate, and common is our way!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dreadful was the dream, so loud she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, starting sudden up, the slumber broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cast her eyes around, in hope to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her vanished lord, and find the vision true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now the maids, who waited her commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran in with lighted tapers in their hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired with the search, not finding what she seeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cruel blows she pounds her blubbered cheeks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from her beaten breast the linen tare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cut the golden caul that bound her hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her nurse demands the cause; with louder cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She prosecutes her griefs, and thus replies.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more Alcyone, she suffered death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her loved lord, when Ceyx lost his breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No flattery, no false comfort, give me none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My shipwrecked Ceyx is for ever gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, I saw him manifest in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice, his figure, and his gestures knew:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His lustre lost, and every living grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I retained the features of his face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though with pale cheeks, wet beard, and dropping hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None but my Ceyx could appear so fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would have strained him with a strict embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through my arms he slipt, and vanished from the place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, even just there he stood;&mdash;and as she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where last the spectre was, she cast her look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain would she hope, and gazed upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any printed footsteps might be found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sighed, and said;&mdash;This I too well foreknew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my prophetic fear presaged too true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas what I begged, when with a bleeding heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took my leave, and suffered thee to part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I to go along, or thou to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never, ah never to divide our way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happier for me, that, all our hours assigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together we had lived, even not in death disjoined!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So had my Ceyx still been living here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with my Ceyx I had perished there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I die absent, in the vast profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me without myself the seas have drowned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storms were not so cruel; should I strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lengthen life, and such a grief survive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neither will I strive, nor wretched thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In death forsake, but keep thee company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not one common sepulchre contains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our bodies, or one urn our last remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Ceyx and Alcyone shall join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their names remembered in one common line.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No farther voice her mighty grief affords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sighs come rushing in betwixt her words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stopt her tongue; but what her tongue denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft tears, and groans, and dumb complaints supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas morning; to the port she takes her way,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or thither by her destiny was brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where last he stood; and while she sadly said,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas here he left me, lingering here, delayed  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His parting kiss, and there his anchors weighed.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus speaking, while her thoughts past actions trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call to mind, admonished by the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp at her utmost ken she cast her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat floating from afar descries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed a corpse adrift, to distant sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at a distance who could judge aright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It wafted nearer yet, and then she knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what before she but surmised was true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A corpse it was, but whose it was, unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet moved, howe'er, she made the case her own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took the bad omen of a shipwrecked man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for a stranger wept, and thus began:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor wretch, on stormy seas to lose thy life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy thou, but more thy widowed wife!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this she paused; for now the flowing tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had brought the body nearer to the side:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more she looks, the more her fears increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At nearer sight, and she's herself the less:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now driven ashore, and at her feet it lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knows too much, in knowing whom she sees,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband's corpse; at this she loudly shrieks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis he, 'tis he, she cries, and tears her cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair, her vest; and, stooping to the sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his neck she casts her trembling hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And is it thus, O dearer than my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, thus return'st thou to thy longing wife!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and to the neighbouring mole she strode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised there to break the incursions of the flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headlong from hence to plunge herself she springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shoots along supported on her wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bird new-made about the banks she plies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far from shore, and short excursions tries;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor seeks in air her humble flight to raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content to skim the surface of the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bill, though slender, sends a creaking noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And imitates a lamentable voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now lighting where the bloodless body lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She with a funeral note renews her cries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At all her stretch her little wings she spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with her feathered arms embraced the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then flickering to his pallid lips, she strove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To print a kiss, the last essay of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the vital touch revived the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that the moving waters raised his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the kiss, the vulgar doubt alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sure a present miracle was shown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods their shapes to winter-birds translate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But both obnoxious to their former fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their conjugal affection still is tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the mournful race is multiplied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bill, they tread; Alcyone compressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven days sits brooding on her floating nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wintery queen: her sire at length is kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calms every storm, and hushes every wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepares his empire for his daughter's ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for his hatching nephews smooths the seas.<br /></span>

<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>&AElig;sacus, the son of Priam, loving a country life, forsakes the court;
living obscurely, he falls in love with a nymph, who, flying from
him, was killed by a serpent; for grief of this, he would have
drowned himself; but, by the pity of the gods, is turned into a
Cormorant. Priam, not hearing of &AElig;sacus, believes him to be
dead, and raises a tomb to preserve his memory. By this transition,
which is one of the finest in all Ovid, the poet naturally
falls into the story of the Trojan war, which is summed up in the
present book; but so very briefly in many places, that Ovid seems
more short than Virgil, contrary to his usual style. Yet the
House of Fame, which is here described, is one of the most beautiful
pieces in the whole Metamorphoses. The fight of Achilles
and Cygnus, and the fray betwixt the Lapith&aelig; and Centaurs,
yield to no other part of this poet; and particularly the loves and
death of Cyllarus and Hylonome, the male and female Centaur,
are wonderfully moving.</i></p>

<span class="i0">The Grecian heroes, and what deaths they dealt.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From these first onsets, the Sig&aelig;an shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was strewed with carcases, and stained with gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neptunian Cygnus troops of Greeks had slain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His white-maned steeds, that bowed beneath the yoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cheered to courage, with a gentle stroke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then urged his fiery chariot on the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising shook his lance, in act to throw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first he cried,&mdash;O youth, be proud to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy death, ennobled by Pelides' spear.&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The lance pursued the voice without delay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the whizzing weapon miss the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pierced his cuirass, with such fury sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And signed his bosom with a purple dint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this the seed of Neptune;&mdash;Goddess-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ornament, not use, these arms are worn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This helm, and heavy buckler, I can spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As only decorations of the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Mars is armed, for glory, not for need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis somewhat more from Neptune to proceed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than from a daughter of the sea to spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sire is mortal; mine is Ocean's king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure of death, I should contemn thy dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though naked, and impassible depart.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and threw; the trembling weapon passed             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Through nine bull-hides, each under other placed,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">On his broad shield, and stuck within the last.             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles wrenched it out; and sent again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hostile gift; the hostile gift was vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried a third, a tough well-chosen spear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inviolable body stood sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Cygnus then did no defence provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scornful offered his unshielded side.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not otherwise the impatient hero fared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than as a bull, encompassed with a guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the circus roars; provoked from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sight of scarlet, and a sanguine war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They quit their ground, his bended horns elude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain pursuing, and in vain pursued.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before to farther fight he would advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood considering, and surveyed his lance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubts if he wielded not a wooden spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a point; he looked, the point was there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is my hand, and this my lance, he said,                <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By which so many thousand foes are dead.                    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">O whither is their usual virtue fled!                       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I had it once; and the Lyrnessian wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tenedos, confessed it in their fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy streams, Caicus, rolled a crimson flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thebes ran red with her own natives' blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice Telephus employed their piercing steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wound him first, and afterward to heal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vigour of this arm was never vain;                      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And that my wonted prowess I retain,                        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Witness these heaps of slaughter on the plain.&mdash;       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and, doubtful of his former deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some new trial of his force proceeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He chose Men&aelig;tes from among the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At him he lanced his spear, and pierced his breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the hard earth the Lycian knocked his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay supine; and forth the spirit fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then thus the hero: Neither can I blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand, or javelin; both are still the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same I will employ against this foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wish but with the same success to throw.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So spoke the chief, and while he spoke he threw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weapon with unerring fury flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his left shoulder aimed; nor entrance found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But back, as from a rock, with swift rebound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harmless returned; a bloody mark appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which with false joy the flattered hero cheered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wound there was none; the blood that was in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lance before from slain Men&aelig;tes drew.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Headlong he leaps from off his lofty car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in close fight on foot renews the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raging with high disdain, repeats his blows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shield nor armour can their force oppose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge cantlets of his buckler strew the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no defence in his bored arms is found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on his flesh no wound or blood is seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword itself is blunted on the skin.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<span class="i2">This vain attempt the chief no longer bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But round his hollow temples and his ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His buckler beats: the son of Neptune, stunned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these repeated buffets, quits his ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sickly sweat succeeds, and shades of night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inverted nature swims before his sight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The insulting victor presses on the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treads the steps the vanquished trod before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor rest, nor respite gives. A stone there lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind his trembling foe, and stopped his way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles took the advantage which he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-turned, and pushed him backward on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His buckler held him under, while he pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With both his knees above, his panting breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlaced his helm; about his chin the twist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tied, and soon the strangled soul dismissed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With eager haste he went to strip the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vanquished body from his arms was fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sea-god sire, t'immortalize his fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had turned it to the bird that bears his name.<a id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The feast approached; when to the blue-eyed Maid, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">The reeking entrails on the fire they threw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Heaven had its part in sacrifice; the rest<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The chief invited guests were set around;               <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, hunger first assuaged, the bowls were crowned,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">The mellow harp did not their ears employ,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Discourse, the food of souls, was their delight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The subject, deeds of arms; and valour shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on the Trojan side, or on their own.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What things but these could fierce Achilles tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what could fierce Achilles hear so well?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last great act performed, of Cygnus slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did most the martial audience entertain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering to find a body, free by fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From steel, and which could even that steel rebate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed, their admiration they renew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce Pelides could believe it true.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Nestor, thus;&mdash;What once this age has known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fated Cygnus, and in him alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These eyes have seen in C&aelig;neus long before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose body not a thousand swords could bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&aelig;neus in courage and in strength excelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still his Othrys with his fame is filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what did most his martial deeds adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though, since, he changed his sex,) a woman born.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A novelty so strange, and full of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His listening audience asked him to relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles thus commends their common suit:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O father, first for prudence in repute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell, with that eloquence so much thy own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thou hast heard, or what of C&aelig;neus known;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was he, whence his change of sex begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What trophies, joined in wars with thee, he won?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who conquered him, and in what fatal strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth, without a wound, could lose his life?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neleides then:&mdash;Though tardy age, and time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have shrunk my sinews, and decayed my prime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though much I have forgotten of my store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, not exhausted, I remember more.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that arms atchieved, or peace designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That action still is fresher in my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than aught beside. If reverend age can give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To faith a sanction, in my third I live.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas in my second century, I surveyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young C&aelig;nis, then a fair Thessalian maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&aelig;nis the bright was born to high command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A princess, and a native of thy land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divine Achilles; every tongue proclaimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauty, and her eyes all hearts inflamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peleus, thy sire, perhaps had sought her bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the rest; but he had either led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mother then, or was by promise tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she to him, and all, alike her love denied.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was her fortune once, to take her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the sandy margin of the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Power of Ocean viewed her as she passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, loved as soon as seen, by force embraced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fame reports.  Her virgin treasure seized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his new joys the ravisher so pleased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thus, transported, to the nymph he cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask what thou wilt, no prayer shall be denied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This also fame relates; the haughty fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who not the rape even of a god could bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This answer, proud, returned;&mdash;To mighty wrongs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty recompence, of right, belongs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me no more to suffer such a shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But change the woman for a better name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One gift for all.&mdash;She said, and, while she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stern, majestic, manly tone she took.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man she was; and, as the Godhead swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To C&aelig;neus turned, who C&aelig;nis was before.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this the lover adds, without request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No force of steel should violate his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad of the gift, the new-made warrior goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arms among the Greeks, and longs for equal foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now brave Pirithous, bold Ixion's son,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Down went the board, and, fastening on her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seized with sudden force the frighted fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Eurytus began; his bestial kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crime pursued; and each as pleased his mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An image of a taken town expressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cave resounds with female shrieks: we rise,<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i2">To justify his threat, he thrusts aside<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The monster nought replied; for words were vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeds could only deeds unjust maintain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But answers with his hand, and forward pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blows redoubled, on his face and breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ample goblet stood, of antique mould,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rough with figures of the rising gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hero snatched it up, and tossed in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full at the front of the foul ravisher:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He falls, and falling vomits forth a flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wine, and foam, and brains, and mingled blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half roaring, and half neighing through the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms, arms! the double-formed with fury call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wreak their brother's death. A medley flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bowls and jars, at first, supply the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once instruments of feasts, but now of fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine animates their rage, and arms their hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bold Amycus from the robbed vestry brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chalices of heaven, and holy things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of precious weight; a sconce, that hung on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tapers filled, to light the sacristy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torn from the cord, with his unhallowed hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He threw amid the Lapith&aelig;an band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Celadon the ruin fell, and left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face of feature and of form bereft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when some brawny sacrificer knocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before an altar led, an offered ox,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eye balls, rooted out, are thrown to ground,    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His nose dismantled in his mouth is found,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His jaws, cheeks, front, one undistinguished wound. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">This, Belates, the avenger, could not brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, by the foot, a maple-board he took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurled at Amycus; his chin is bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his chest, and down the Centaur sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, sputtering bloody teeth, the second blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his drawn sword dispatched to shades below.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Grineus was near; and cast a furious look<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And bright with flaming fires; The gods, he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have with their holy trade our hands supplied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why use we not their gifts?&mdash;Then from the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An altar-stone he heaved, with all the load it bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Altar and altar's freight together flew,    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where thickest thronged the Lapith&aelig;an crew, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, at once, Broteas and Oryus slew.       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Oryus' mother, Mycale, was known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from her sphere to draw the labouring moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Exadius cried,&mdash;Unpunished shall not go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fact, if arms are found against the foe.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked about, where on a pine were spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The votive horns of a stag's branching head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Grineus these he throws; so just they fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sharp antlers stuck in either eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless and blind he fell; with blood besmeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eye-balls beaten out hung dangling on his beard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce Rh&aelig;tus from the hearth a burning brand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fire took flame; then dashed it from the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On fair Charaxus' temples, near the sight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whistling pest came on, and pierced the bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught the yellow hair, that shrivelled while it shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught, like dry stubble fired, or like seerwood; <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet from the wound ensued no purple flood         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But looked a bubbling mass of frying blood.       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His blazing locks sent forth a crackling sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hissed, like red-hot iron within the smithy drowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wounded warrior shook his flaming hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then (what a team of horse could hardly rear,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heaves the threshold-stone, but could not throw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weight itself forbad the threatened blow;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which, dropping from his lifted arms, came down<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So by their fellows may our foes be sped.&mdash;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then with redoubled strokes he plies his head:      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The burning lever not deludes his pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But drives the battered skull within the brains.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus flushed, the conqueror, with force renewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evagrus, Dryas, Corythus, pursued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, Corythus, with downy cheeks, he slew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fall when fierce Evagrus had in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried,&mdash;What palm is from a beardless prey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rh&aelig;tus prevents what more he had to say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drove within his mouth the fiery death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which entered hissing in, and choked his breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Dryas next he flew; but weary chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer would the same success advance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, while he whirled in fiery circles round     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The brand, a sharpened stake strong Dryas found, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in the shoulder's joint inflicts the wound.  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The weapon struck; which, roaring out with pain,   <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He drew; nor longer durst the fight maintain,      <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But turned his back for fear, and fled amain.      <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With him fled Orneus, with like dread possessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thaumas and Medon, wounded in the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mermeros, in the late race renowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now limping ran, and tardy with his wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pholus and Melaneus from fight withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Abas maimed, who boars encountering slew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And augur Astylos, whose art in vain        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">All, one by one, and fighting face to face:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The club hung round his ears, and battered brows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He falls; and, lashing up his heels, his rider throws.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The same Herculean arms Nedymnus wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay by him Lycotas on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hippasus, whose beard his breast invades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ripheus, haunter of the woodland shades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tereus, used with mountain-bears to strive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their dens to draw the indignant beasts alive.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Demoleon could not bear this hateful sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the long fortune of the Athenian knight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pulled with all his force, to disengage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From earth a pine, the product of an age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The root stuck fast: the broken trunk he sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Theseus: Theseus frustrates his intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaps aside, by Pallas warned, the blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shun: (for so he said; and we believed it so.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not in vain the enormous weight was cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Crantor's body sundered at the waist:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father's squire, Achilles, and his care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, conquered in the Dolopeian war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their king, his present ruin to prevent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pledge of peace implored, to Peleus sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sire, with grieving eyes, beheld his fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, Not long, loved Crantor, shalt thou wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy vowed revenge.&mdash;At once he said, and threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ashen-spear, which quivered as it flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all his force and all his soul applied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sharp point entered in the Centaur's side:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both hands, to wrench it out, the monster joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrenched it out, but left the steel behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuck in his lungs it stood; enraged he rears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hoofs, and down to ground thy father bears.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus trampled under foot, his shield defends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head; his other hand the lance portends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even while he lay extended on the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sped the Centaur, with one single thrust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two more his lance before transfixed from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two his sword had slain in closer war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these was added Dorylas; who spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bull's two goring horns around his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these he pushed; in blood already dyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him, fearless, I approached, and thus defied;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, monster, now, by proof it shall appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether thy horns are sharper, or my spear.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this, I threw; for want of other ward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lifted up his hand, his front to guard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand it passed, and fixed it to his brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud shouts of ours attend the lucky blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him Peleus finished, with a second wound,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which through the navel pierced; he reeled around, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">Trod what he dragged, and what he trod he crushed;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nor could thy form, O Cyllarus, foreshow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fate, if form to monsters men allow:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Add but a horse's head and neck, and he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Castor, was a courser worthy thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was his back proportioned for the seat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rose his brawny chest; so swiftly moved his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coal-black his colour, but like jet it shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His legs and flowing tail were white alone.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>

<span class="i0">The scarf of furs, that hung below her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ermine, or the panther's spotted pride;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Uncertain from what hand, a flying dart<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At least her words were in her clamour drowned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my stunned ears received no vocal sound.<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Betwixt the embattled ranks began to prance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of his helm, and Macedonian lance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rode the ring around, that either host<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our town destroyed, our common labour lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O could I meet him! But I wish too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prove my trident is not in his fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let him try (for that's allowed) thy dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierce his only penetrable part.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Apollo bows to the superior throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his uncle's anger adds his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in a cloud involved, he takes his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Greeks and Trojans mixed in mortal fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found out Paris, lurking where he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stained his arrows with plebeian blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ph&oelig;bus to him alone the god confessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the recreant knight he thus addressed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou not blush, to spend thy shafts in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a degenerate and ignoble train?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fame, or better vengeance, be thy care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There aim, and with one arrow end the war.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said; and shewed from far the blazing shield       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sword, which but Achilles none could wield;       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And how he moved a god, and mowed the standing field. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The deity himself directs aright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The envenomed shaft, and wings the fatal flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus fell the foremost of the Grecian name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, the base adulterer, boasts the fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spectacle to glad the Trojan train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And please old Priam, after Hector slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If by a female hand he had foreseen                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He was to die, his wish had rather been             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The lance and double axe of the fair warrior queen. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And now, the terror of the Trojan field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian honour, ornament, and shield,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">High on a pile, the unconquered chief is placed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god,<a id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that armed him first, consumed at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the mighty man, the small remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little urn, and scarcely filled, contains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, great in Homer, still Achilles lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, equal to himself, himself survives.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His buckler owns its former lord, and brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New cause of strife betwixt contending kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who worthiest, after him, his sword to wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wear his armour, or sustain his shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Diomede sat mute, with downcast eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conscious of wanted worth to win the prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Menelaus presumed these arms to claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor he the king of men, a greater name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two rivals only rose; Laertes' son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vast bulk of Ajax Telamon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king, who cherished each with equal love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from himself all envy would remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left both to be determined by the laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the Grecian chiefs transferred the cause.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The chiefs were set, the soldiers crowned the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these the master of the sevenfold shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upstarted fierce; and, kindled with disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager to speak, unable to contain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His boiling rage, he rolled his eyes around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shore, and Grecian gallies hauled a-ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretching out his hands, O Jove, he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must then our cause before the fleet be tried?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dares Ulysses for the prize contend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sight of what he durst not once defend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But basely fled, that memorable day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I from Hector's hands redeemed the flaming prey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much 'tis safer at the noisy bar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words to flourish, than engage in war.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By different methods we maintained our right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor am I made to talk, nor he to fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bloody fields I labour to be great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms are a smooth tongue, and soft deceit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor need I speak my deeds, for those you see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun and day are witnesses for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him, who fights unseen, relate his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vouch the silent stars, and conscious moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great is the prize demanded, I confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such an abject rival makes it less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gift, those honours, he but hoped to gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can leave no room for Ajax to be vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Losing he wins, because his name will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ennobled by defeat, who durst contend with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were mine own valour questioned, yet my blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without that plea would make my title good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sire was Telamon, whose arms, employed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Hercules, these Trojan walls destroyed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who before, with Jason, sent from Greece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the first ship brought home the golden fleece:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Telamon from &AElig;acus derives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His birth: (the inquisitor of guilty lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shades below; where Sisyphus, whose son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This thief is thought, rolls up the restless heavy stone.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just &AElig;acus the king of gods above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begot; thus Ajax is the third from Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor should I seek advantage from my line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless, Achilles, it were mixed with thine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As next of kin Achilles' arms I claim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fellow would ingraft a foreign name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon our stock, and the Sisyphian seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fraud and theft asserts his father's breed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then must I lose these arms, because I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight uncalled, a voluntary name?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shunned the cause, but offered you my aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he, long lurking, was to war betrayed:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Forced to the field he came, but in the rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feigned distraction, to conceal his fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one more cunning caught him in the snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill for himself, and dragged him into war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let a hero's arms a coward vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, who shunned all honours, gain the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me stand excluded from my right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robbed of my kinsman's arms, who first appeared in fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better for us at home he had remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had it been true the madness which he feigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so believed; the less had been our shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The less his counselled crime, which brands the Grecian name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Philoctetes had been left inclosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a bare isle, to wants and pains exposed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where to the rocks, with solitary groans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sufferings and our baseness he bemoans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wishes (so may heaven his wish fulfil!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The due reward to him who caused his ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now he, with us to Troy's destruction sworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our brother of the war, by whom are borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alcides' arrows, pent in narrow bounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cold and hunger pinched, and pained with wounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find him food and clothing, must employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the birds the shafts due to the fate of Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still he lives, and lives from treason free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he left Ulysses' company;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Palamede might wish, so void of aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather to have been left, than so to death betrayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coward bore the man immortal spite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shamed him out of madness into fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor daring otherwise to vent his hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accused him first of treason to the state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, for proof, produced the golden store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself had hidden in his tent before.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus of two champions he deprived our host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By exile one, and one by treason lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fights Ulysses, thus his fame extends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A formidable man, but to his friends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great, for what greatness is in words and sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even faithful Nestor less in both is found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, that he might without a rival reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left his faithful Nestor on the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook his friend even at his utmost need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, tired, and tardy with his wounded steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out for aid, and called him by his name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cowardice has neither ears nor shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fled the good old man, bereft of aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for as much as lay in him, betrayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this is not a fable forged by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one of his, an Ulyssean lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I vouch even Diomede, who, though his friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot that act excuse, much less defend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called him back aloud, and taxed his fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure enough he heard, but durst not hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gods with equal eyes on mortals look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He justly was forsaken, who forsook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanted that succour he refused to lend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found every fellow such another friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wonder if he roared, that all might hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His elocution was increased by fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard, I ran, I found him out of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, trembling, and half-dead with fear of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he had judged himself by his own laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood condemned, I helped the common cause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my broad buckler hid him from the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Even the shield trembled as he lay below,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from impending fate the coward freed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good heaven forgive me for so bad a deed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If still he will persist, and urge the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First let him give me back his forfeit life;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Let him return to that opprobrious field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again creep under my protecting shield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him lie wounded, let the foe be near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let his quivering heart confess his fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There put him in the very jaws of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him plead his cause in that estate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, when snatched from death, when from below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lifted shield I loosed, and let him go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good heavens, how light he rose! with what a bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sprung from earth, forgetful of his wound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fresh, how eager then his feet to ply!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had not strength to stand, had speed to fly!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hector came on, and brought the gods along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear seized alike the feeble and the strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each Greek was an Ulysses; such a dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The approach, and even the sound, of Hector bred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him, fleshed with slaughter, and with conquest crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met, and overturned him to the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When after, matchless as he deemed in might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He challenged all our host to single fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eyes were fixed on me; the lots were thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for your champion I was wished alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I returned unvanquished from the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Jove to friend, the insulting Trojan came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And menaced us with force, our fleet with flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it the strength of this tongue-valiant lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that black hour, that saved you from the sword?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or was my breast exposed alone, to brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand swords, a thousand ships to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hopes of your return? and can you yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a saved fleet, less than a single shield?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think it no boast, O Grecians, if I deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These arms want Ajax, more than Ajax them;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or, I with them an equal honour share;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, honoured to be worn, and I, to wear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will he compare my courage with his slight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well he may compare the day with night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night is indeed the province of his reign;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all his dark exploits no more contain <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Than a spy taken, and a sleeper slain;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A priest made prisoner, Pallas made a prey;   <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But none of all these actions done by day;    <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught of these was done, and Diomede away.<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">If on such petty merits you confer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So vast a prize, let each his portion share;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make a just dividend; and, if not all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greater part to Diomede will fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why for Ithacus such arms as those,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who naked, and by night, invades his foes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering helm by moonlight will proclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The latent robber, and prevent his game;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could he hold his tottering head upright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath that motion, or sustain the weight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor that right arm could toss the beamy lance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much less the left that ampler shield advance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ponderous with precious weight, and rough with cost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the round world in rising gold embossed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That orb would ill become his hand to wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look, as for the gold he stole the shield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which should your error on the wretch bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would not frighten, but allure the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why asks he what avails him not in fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would but cumber and retard his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which his only excellence is placed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You give him death, that intercept his haste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add, that his own is yet a maiden-shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the least dint has suffered in the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guiltless of fight; mine, battered, hewed, and bored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn out of service, must forsake his lord.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What farther need of words our right to scan?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My arguments are deeds, let action speak the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since from a champion's arms the strife arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cast the glorious prize amid the foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then send us to redeem both arms and shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him wear, who wins them in the field.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said:&mdash;A murmur from the multitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or somewhat like a stifled shout, ensued;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from his seat arose Laertes' son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked down a while, and paused ere he begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the expecting audience raised his look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not without prepared attention spoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft was his tone, and sober was his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Action his words, and words his action grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If heaven, my lords, had heard our common prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These arms had caused no quarrel for an heir;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still great Achilles had his own possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we with great Achilles had been blessed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since hard fate, and heaven's severe decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ravished him away from you and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(At this he sighed, and wiped his eyes, and drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seemed to draw, some drops of kindly dew,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who better can succeed Achilles lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than he who gave Achilles to your host?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This only I request, that neither he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May gain, by being what he seems to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stupid thing, nor I may lose the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By having sense, which heaven to him denies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, great or small, the talent I enjoyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ever in the common cause employed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let my wit, and wonted eloquence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which often has been used in your defence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my own, this only time be brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear against myself, and deemed a fault.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make not a crime, where nature made it none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every man may freely use his own.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of long descended ancestors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are but by grace of imputation ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs in effect; but since he draws his line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Jove, and seems to plead a right divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Jove, like him, I claim my pedigree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And am descended in the same degree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sire Laertes, was Arcesius' heir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcesius was the son of Jupiter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No parricide, no banished man, is known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all my line; let him excuse his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hermes ennobles too my mother's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By both my parents to the gods allied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not because that on the female part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My blood is better, dare I claim desert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that my sire from parricide is free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But judge by merit betwixt him and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prize be to the best; provided yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ajax for a while his kin forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his great sire, and greater uncle's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fortify by them his feeble claim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be kindred and relation laid aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honour's cause by laws of honour tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if he plead proximity of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That empty title is with ease withstood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peleus, the hero's sire, more nigh than he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pyrrhus, his undoubted progeny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inherit first these trophies of the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Scyros, or to Phthia, send the shield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Teucer has an uncle's right, yet he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waves his pretensions, nor contends with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, since the cause on pure desert is placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence shall I take my rise, what reckon last?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I not presume on every act to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But take these few, in order as they fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thetis, who knew the fates, applied her care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep Achilles in disguise from war;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, till the threatening influence were past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman's habit on the hero cast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eyes were cozened by the borrowed vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ajax (never wiser than the rest)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found no Pelides there: At length I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With proffered wares to this pretended dame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, not discovered by her mien or voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed her manhood by her manly choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while on female toys her fellows look,       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Grasped in her warlike hand, a javelin shook;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, by this act revealed, I thus bespoke:&mdash;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">O goddess-born! resist not heaven's decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fall of Ilium is reserved for thee;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seized him, and, produced in open light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent blushing to the field the fatal knight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine then are all his actions of the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Telephus was conquered by my spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after cured; to me the Thebans owe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lesbos and Tenedos, their overthrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scyros and Cylla; not on all to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By me Lyrnessus and strong Chrysa fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, since I sent the man who Hector slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me the noble Hector's death is due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those arms I put into his living hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those arms, Pelides dead, I now demand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When Greece was injured in the Spartan prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And met at Aulis to revenge the offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a dead calm, or adverse blasts, that reigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the port the wind-bound fleet detained:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bad signs were seen, and oracles severe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were daily thundered in our general's ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That by his daughter's blood we must appease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diana's kindled wrath, and free the seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affection, interest, fame, his heart assailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the father o'er the king prevailed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold, on himself he took the pious crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As angry with the gods as they with him.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
<span class="i0">No subject could sustain their sovereign's look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till this hard enterprize I undertook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only durst the imperial power controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And undermined the parent in his soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced him to exert the king for common good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pay our ransom with his daughter's blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never was cause more difficult to plead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than where the judge against himself decreed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this I won by dint of argument.       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The wrongs his injured brother underwent, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And his own office, shamed him to consent.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas harder yet to move the mother's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to this heavy task was I designed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reasons against her love I knew were vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I circumvented whom I could not gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Ajax been employed, our slackened sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had still at Aulis waited happy gales.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Arrived at Troy, your choice was fixed on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fearless envoy, fit for a bold embassy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure, I entered through the hostile court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering with steel, and crowded with resort:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the midst of arms, I plead our cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urge the foul rape, and violated laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accuse the foes as authors of the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reproach the ravisher, demand the wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Priam, Antenor, and the wiser few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I moved; but Paris and his lawless crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce held their hands, and lifted swords; but stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In act to quench their impious thirst of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Menelaus knows; exposed to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me the rough preludium of the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Endless it were to tell what I have done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arms, or counsel, since the siege begun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first encounters past, the foe repelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They skulked within the town, we kept the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War seemed asleep for nine long years; at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both sides resolved to push, we tried our strength.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now what did Ajax while our arms took breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Versed only in the gross mechanic trade of death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you require my deeds, with ambushed arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trapped the foe, or tired with false alarms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secured the ships, drew lines along the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fainting cheered, chastised the rebel-train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provided forage, our spent arms renewed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Employed at home, or sent abroad, the common cause pursued.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The king, deluded in a dream by Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despaired to take the town, and ordered to remove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What subject durst arraign the power supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Producing Jove to justify his dream?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ajax might wish the soldiers to retain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From shameful flight, but wishes were in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wanting of effect had been his words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as of course his thundering tongue affords.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But did this boaster threaten, did he pray,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or by his own example urge their stay?     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">None, none of these, but ran himself away. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him run, and was ashamed to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who plied his feet so fast to get aboard as he?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then speeding through the place, I made a stand,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And loudly cried,&mdash;O base degenerate band, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To leave a town already in your hand!           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">After so long expence of blood, for fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring home nothing but perpetual shame!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These words, or what I have forgotten since,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For grief inspired me then with eloquence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reduced their minds; they leave the crowded port,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to their late forsaken camp resort.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismayed the council met; this man was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mute, and not recovered of his fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thersites taxed the king, and loudly railed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his wide opening mouth with blows I sealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, rising, I excite their souls to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindle sleeping virtue into flame.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From thence, whatever he performed in fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is justly mine, who drew him back from flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which of the Grecian chiefs consorts with thee?  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But Diomede desires my company,                  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And still communicates his praise with me.       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">As guided by a god, secure he goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed with my fellowship, amid the foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure no little merit I may boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom such a man selects from such an host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unforced by lots, I went without affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dare with him the dangers of the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the same errand sent, we met the spy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hector, double-tongued, and used to lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him I dispatched, but not till, undermined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drew him first to tell what treacherous Troy designed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My task performed, with praise I had retired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, not content with this, to greater praise aspired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invaded Rh&oelig;sus, and his Thracian crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him, and his, in their own strength, I slew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returned a victor, all my vows complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the king's chariot, in his royal seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse me now his arms, whose fiery steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were promised to the spy for his nocturnal deeds;<a id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let dull Ajax bear away my right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all his days outbalance this one night.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor fought I darkling still; the sun beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With slaughtered Lycians when I strewed the field:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You saw, and counted as I passed along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alastor, Cromius, Ceranos the strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alcander, Prytanis, and Halius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noemon, Charopes, and Ennomus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choon, Chersidamas, and five beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men of obscure descent, but courage tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these this hand laid breathless on the ground.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor want I proofs of many a manly wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All honest, all before; believe not me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words may deceive, but credit what you see.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At this he bared his breast, and showed his scars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of a furrowed field, well ploughed with wars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is this part unexercised, said he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That giant bulk of his from wounds is free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe in his shield he fears no foe to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And better manages his blood than I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this avails me not; our boaster strove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not with our foes alone, but partial Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save the fleet. This I confess is true,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I take from any man his due;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, thus assuming all, he robs from you. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some part of honour to your share will fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did the best indeed, but did not all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patroclus in Achilles' arms, and thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chief he seemed, with equal ardour fought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserved the fleet, repelled the raging fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forced the fearful Trojans to retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Ajax boasts, that he was only thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A match for Hector, who the combat sought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure he forgets the king, the chiefs, and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All were as eager for the fight as he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He but the ninth, and, not by public voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ours preferred, was only fortune's choice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fought; nor can our hero boast the event,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hector from the field unwounded went.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why am I forced to name that fatal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That snatched the prop and pride of Greece away?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw Pelides sink, with pious grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ran in vain, alas! to his relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the brave soul was fled; full of my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rushed amid the war, his relics to defend;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ceased my toil till I redeemed the prey,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those arms, which on these shoulders then I bore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">None is endued with a more grateful mind.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These arms, thus laboured, for her son prepare,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That Ajax after him the heavenly gift should wear?<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For that dull soul to stare, with stupid eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the learned unintelligible prize?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are to him the sculptures of the shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's planets, earth, and ocean's watery field?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pleiads, Hyads; Less, and Greater Bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undipped in seas; Orion's angry star;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two differing cities, graved on either hand?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against my late accession to the wars!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does not the fool perceive his argument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is with more force against Achilles bent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if dissembling be so great a crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fault is common, and the same in him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he taxes both of long delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My guilt is less, who sooner came away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pious mother, anxious for his life,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From a long voyage free, and from a longer war.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He took the counsel, and he lives at least;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mind is the man; I claim my whole desert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the mind's vigour, and the immortal part.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But you, O Grecian chiefs, reward my care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be grateful to your watchman of the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all my labours in so long a space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure I may plead a title to your grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter the town; I then unbarred the gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I removed their tutelary fates.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all our common hopes, if hopes they be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I have now reduced to certainty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By falling Troy, by yonder tottering towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by their taken gods, which now are ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if there yet a farther task remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be performed by prudence or by pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If yet some desperate action rests behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That asks high conduct, and a dauntless mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If aught be wanting to the Trojan doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which none but I can manage and o'ercome;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Award those arms I ask, by your decree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or give to this what you refuse to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He ceased, and, ceasing, with respect he bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his hand at once the fatal statue shewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven, air, and ocean rung, with loud applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the general vote he gained his cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus conduct won the prize, when courage failed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eloquence o'er brutal force prevailed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Acis, the lovely youth, whose loss I mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Faunus and the nymph Symethis born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was both his parents' pleasure; but to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all that love could make a lover be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods our minds in mutual bands did join;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was his only joy, and he was mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sixteen summers the sweet youth had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doubtful down began to shade his chin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Polyphemus first disturbed our joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loved me fiercely, as I loved the boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask not which passion in my soul was higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My last aversion, or my first desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor this the greater was, nor that the less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both were alike, for both were in excess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, Venus, thee both heaven and earth obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immense thy power, and boundless is thy sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops, who defied the &aelig;therial throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought no thunder louder than his own,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The terror of the woods, and wilder far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than wolves in plains, or bears in forests are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inhuman host, who made his bloody feasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mangled members of his butchered guests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet felt the force of love, and fierce desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burnt for me, with unrelenting fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot his caverns, and his woolly care,         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Assumed the softness of a lover's air,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And combed, with teeth of rakes, his rugged hair.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Now with a crooked scythe his beard he sleeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mows the stubborn stubble of his cheeks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in the crystal stream he looks, to try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His simagres,<a id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and rolls his glaring eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cruelty and thirst of blood are lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ships securely sail along the coast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prophet Telemus (arrived by chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where &AElig;tna's summits to the seas advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who marked the tracks of every bird that flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure presages from their flying drew,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold the Cyclops, that Ulysses' hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his broad eye should thrust a flaming brand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant, with a scornful grin, replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain augur, thou hast falsely prophesied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already Love his flaming brand has tost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking on two fair eyes, my sight I lost.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, warned in vain, with stalking pace he strode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stamped the margin of the briny flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heavy steps, and, weary, sought agen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cool retirement of his gloomy den.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A promontory, sharpening by degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ends in a wedge, and overlooks the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either side, below, the water flows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This airy walk the giant-lover chose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on the midst he sate; his flocks, unled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shepherd followed, and securely fed.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A pine so burly, and of length so vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sailing ships required it for a mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wielded for a staff, his steps to guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But laid it by, his whistle while he tried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred reeds, of a prodigious growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce made a pipe proportioned to his mouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which when he gave it wind, the rocks around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watery plains, the dreadful hiss resound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the ruffian shepherd rudely blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in a hollow cave, I sat below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Acis' bosom I my head reclined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still preserve the poem in my mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O lovely Galatea, whiter far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than falling snows, and rising lilies are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More flowery than the meads, as crystal bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect as alders, and of equal height;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More wanton than a kid; more sleek thy skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than orient shells, that on the shores are seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than apples fairer, when the boughs they lade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasing, as winter suns, or summer shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More grateful to the sight than goodly plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softer to the touch than down of swans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or curds new turned; and sweeter to the taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than swelling grapes, that to the vintage haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More clear than ice, or running streams, that stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through garden plots, but ah! more swift than they.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet, Galatea, harder to be broke            <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Than bullocks, unreclaimed to bear the yoke,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And far more stubborn than the knotted oak; <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Like sliding streams, impossible to hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like them fallacious, like their fountains cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More warping than the willow, to decline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My warm embrace; more brittle than the vine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immoveable, and fixt in thy disdain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rough, as these rocks, and of a harder grain;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<span class="i0">More violent than is the rising flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the praised peacock is not half so proud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce as the fire, and sharp as thistles are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more outrageous than a mother bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deaf as the billows to the vows I make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more revengeful than a trodden snake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In swiftness fleeter than the flying hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or driven tempests, or the driving wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other faults with patience I can bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But swiftness is the vice I only fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet, if you knew me well, you would not shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love, but to my wished embraces run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would languish in your turn, and court my stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much repent of your unwise delay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My palace, in the living rock, is made         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By nature's hand; a spacious pleasing shade,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which neither heat can pierce, nor cold invade.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">My garden filled with fruits you may behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grapes in clusters, imitating gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some blushing bunches of a purple hue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these, and those, are all reserved for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red strawberries in shades expecting stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud to be gathered by so white a hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Autumnal cornels latter fruit provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plumbs, to tempt you, turn their glossy side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not those of common kinds, but such alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in Ph&aelig;acian orchards might have grown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor chesnuts shall be wanting to your food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor garden-fruits, nor wildings of the wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laden boughs for you alone shall bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yours shall be the product of the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flocks you see are all my own, beside    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The rest that woods and winding vallies hide,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And those that folded in the caves abide.    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ask not the numbers of my growing store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows how many, knows he has no more.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I praise my cattle; trust not me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But judge yourself, and pass your own decree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold their swelling dugs; the sweepy weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ewes, that sink beneath the milky freight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the warm folds their tender lambkins lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apart from kids, that call with human cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New milk in nut-brown bowls is duly served<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For daily drink, the rest for cheese reserved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor are these household dainties all my store;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The fields and forests will afford us more;   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The deer, the hare, the goat, the savage boar.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All sorts of venison, and of birds the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pair of turtles taken from the nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walked the mountains, and two cubs<a id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> I found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose dam had left them on the naked ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So like, that no distinction could be seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pretty, they were presents for a queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they shall; I took them both away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep, to be companions of your play.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh raise, fair nymph, your beauteous face above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves; nor scorn my presents, and my love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Galatea, come, and view my face;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I late beheld it in the watery glass,      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And found it lovelier than I feared it was.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Survey my towering stature, and my size:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Jove, the Jove you dream, that rules the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears such a bulk, or is so largely spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My locks (the plenteous harvest of my head,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang o'er my manly face, and dangling down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a shady grove, my shoulders crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor think, because my limbs and body bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thick-set underwood of bristling hair,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My shape deformed; what fouler sight can be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the bald branches of a leafless tree?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foul is the steed without a flowing mane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And birds, without their feathers, and their train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wool decks the sheep; and man receives a grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bushy limbs, and from a bearded face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My forehead with a single eye is filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round as a ball, and ample as a shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious lamp of heaven, the radiant sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Nature's eye; and she's content with one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add, that my father sways your seas, and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like you, am of the watry family.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I make you his, in making you my own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You I adore, and kneel to you alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove, with his fabled thunder, I despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only fear the lightning of your eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frown not, fair nymph! yet I could bear to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdained, if others were disdained with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to repulse the Cyclops, and prefer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love of Acis,&mdash;heavens! I cannot bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let the stripling please himself; nay more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please you, though that's the thing I most abhor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy shall find, if e'er we cope in fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These giant limbs endued with giant might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His living bowels from his belly torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scattered limbs, shall on the flood be borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy flood, ungrateful nymph; and fate shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That way for thee and Acis to be joined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For oh! I burn with love, and thy disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Augments at once my passion, and my pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Translated &AElig;tna flames within my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, inhuman, wilt not ease my smart.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lamenting thus in vain, he rose, and strode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With furious paces to the neigbouring wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restless his feet, distracted was his walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad were his motions, and confused his talk;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Mad as the vanquished bull, when forced to yield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lovely mistress, and forsake the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus far unseen I saw; when, fatal chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His looks directing, with a sudden glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acis and I were to his sight betrayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, nought suspecting, we securely played.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his wide mouth a bellowing cry he cast,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see, I see, but this shall be your last.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A roar so loud made &AElig;tna to rebound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Cyclops laboured in the sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affrighted with his monstrous voice, I fled,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in the neighbouring ocean plunged my head. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Acis turned his back, and, Help, he cried,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Help, Galatea! help, my parent Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take me, dying, to your deep abodes!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops followed; but he sent before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rib, which from the living rock he tore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though but an angle reached him of the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty fragment was enough alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crush all Acis; 'twas too late to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what the fates allowed to give, I gave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Acis to his lineage should return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roll among the river Gods his urn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight issued from the stone a stream of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which lost the purple, mingling with the flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then like a troubled torrent it appeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The torrent too, in little space, was cleared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stone was cleft, and through the yawning chink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New reeds arose, on the new river's brink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rock, from out its hollow womb, disclosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sound like water in its course opposed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When (wonderous to behold!) full in the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up starts a youth, and navel-high he stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horns from his temples rise; and either horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick wreaths of reeds (his native growth) adorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were not his stature taller than before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bulk augmented, and his beauty more,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His colour blue, for Acis he might pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Acis, changed into a stream, he was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, mine no more, he rolls along the plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rapid motion, and his name retains.<br /></span>

to have begun his acquaintance with that philosopher at Crotona,
a town in Italy; from thence he makes a digression to the
moral and natural philosophy of Pythagoras; on both which our
author enlarges; and which are the most learned and beautiful
parts of the Metamorphoses.</i></p>

<span class="i0">And fill the throne where Romulus had sate. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Renown, which oft bespeaks the public voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had recommended Numa to their choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peaceful, pious prince; who, not content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know the Sabine rites, his study bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cultivate his mind; to learn the laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature, and explore their hidden cause.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Urged by this care, his country he forsook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Crotona thence his journey took.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived, he first enquired the founder's name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this new colony; and whence he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus a senior of the place replies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well read, and curious of antiquities.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis said, Alcides hither took his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Spain, and drove along his conquered prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, leaving in the fields his grazing cows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought himself some hospitable house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Croton entertained his godlike guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he repaired his weary limbs with rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hero, thence departing, blessed the place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here, he said, in time's revolving race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rising town shall take its name from thee.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revolving time fulfilled the prophecy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Myscelos, the justest man on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alemon's son, at Argos had his birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him Hercules, armed with his club of oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'ershadowed in a dream, and thus bespoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, leave thy native soil, and make abode        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where &AElig;saris rolls down his rapid flood;&mdash;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He said; and sleep forsook him, and the God.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling he waked, and rose with anxious heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His country laws forbad him to depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should he do? 'Twas death to go away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the God menaced if he dared to stay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day he doubted, and, when night came on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep, and the same forewarning dream, begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the God stood threatening o'er his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With added curses if he disobeyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice warned, he studied flight; but would convey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once, his person and his wealth away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while he lingered, his design was heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A speedy process formed, and death declared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witness there needed none of his offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against himself the wretch was evidence;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Condemned, and destitute of human aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him, for whom he suffered, thus he prayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Power, who hast deserved in heaven a throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not given, but by thy labours made thy own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity thy suppliant, and protect his cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thou hast made obnoxious to the laws!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A custom was of old, and still remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which life or death by suffrages ordains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White stones and black within an urn are cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first absolve, but fate is in the last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judges to the common urn bequeath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their votes, and drop the sable signs of death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The box receives all black; but, poured from thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stones came candid forth, the hue of innocence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Alimonides his safety won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserved from death by Alcumena's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to his kinsman God his vows he pays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cuts with prosperous gales the Ionian seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leaves Tarentum, favoured by the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thurine bays, and Temises, behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft Sibaris, and all the capes that stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the shore, he makes in sight of land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still doubling, and still coasting, till he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mouth of &AElig;saris, and promised ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then saw where, on the margin of the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tomb that held the bones of Croton stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, by the God's command, he built and walled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place predicted, and Crotona called.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fame, from time to time, delivers down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sure tradition of the Italian town.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here dwelt the man divine whom Samos bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now self-banished from his native shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he hated tyrants, nor could bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chains which none but servile souls will wear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, though from heaven remote, to heaven could move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strength of mind, and tread the abyss above;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And penetrate, with his interior light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those upper depths, which Nature hid from sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what he had observed, and learnt from thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved in familiar language to dispense.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The crowd with silent admiration stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard him, as they heard their god's command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he discoursed of heaven's mysterious laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's original, and nature's cause;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what was God, and why the fleecy snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence fell, and rattling winds arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shook the stedfast earth, and whence begun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dance of planets round the radiant sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thunder was the voice of angry Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or clouds, with nitre pregnant, burst above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these, and things beyond the common reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke, and charmed his audience with his speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He first the taste of flesh from tables drove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And argued well, if arguments could move.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mortals! from your fellows' blood abstain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor taint your bodies with a food profane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While corn and pulse by nature are bestowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And planted orchards bend their willing load;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While laboured gardens wholsome herbs produce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teeming vines afford their generous juice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tardier fruits of cruder kind are lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tamed with fire, or mellowed by the frost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While kine to pails distended udders bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bees their honey, redolent of spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While earth not only can your needs supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, lavish of her store, provides for luxury;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A guiltless feast administers with ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without blood is prodigal to please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild beasts their maws with their slain brethren fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet not all, for some refuse to kill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheep, goats, and oxen, and the nobler steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On browz, and corn, the flowery meadows feed.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bears, tigers, wolves, the lion's angry brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom heaven endued with principles of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wisely sundered from the rest, to yell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In forests, and in lonely caves to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where stronger beasts oppress the weak by might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all in prey and purple feasts delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O impious use! to Nature's laws opposed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where bowels are in other bowels closed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, fattened by their fellows' fat, they thrive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maintained by murder, and by death they live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis then for nought that mother earth provides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stores of all she shows, and all she hides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If men with fleshly morsels must be fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chew with bloody teeth the breathing bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What else is this but to devour our guests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barbarously renew Cyclopean feasts!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, by destroying life, our life sustain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gorge the ungodly maw with meats obscene.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not so the golden age, who fed on fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor durst with bloody meals their mouths pollute.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then birds in airy space might safely move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And timorous hares on heaths securely rove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor needed fish the guileful hooks to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all was peaceful, and that peace sincere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever was the wretch (and cursed be he!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That envied first our food's simplicity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The essay of bloody feasts on brutes began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, after, forged the sword to murder man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he the sharpened steel alone employed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On beasts of prey, that other beasts destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or men invaded with their fangs and paws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This had been justified by Nature's laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And self-defence; but who did feasts begin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flesh, he stretched necessity to sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kill man-killers man has lawful power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not the extended licence, to devour.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why thus affrighted at an empty name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dream of darkness, and fictitious flame?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What feels the body when the soul expires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By time corrupted, or consumed by fires?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dies the spirit, but new life repeats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In other forms, and only changes seats.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even I, who these mysterious truths declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was once Euphorbus in the Trojan war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name and lineage I remember well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how in fight by Sparta's king I fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Argive Juno's fane I late beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My buckler hung on high, and owned my former shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then death, so called, is but old matter dressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some new figure, and a varied vest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus all things are but altered, nothing dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there the unbodied spirit flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By time, or force, or sickness dispossest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lodges, where it lights, in man or beast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hunts without, till ready limbs it find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And actuates those according to their kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tenement to tenement is tossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul is still the same, the figure only lost:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now called by one, now by another name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The form is only changed, the wax is still the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So death, so called, can but the form deface;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The immortal soul flies out in empty space,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To seek her fortune in some other place.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Then let not piety be put to flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please the taste of glutton appetite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But suffer inmate souls secure to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest from their seats your parents you expel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rabid hunger feed upon your kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from a beast dislodge a brother's mind.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This let me further add, that nature knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stedfast station, but, or ebbs, or flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever in motion, she destroys her old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And casts new figures in another mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even times are in perpetual flux, and run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like rivers from their fountain, rolling on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For time, no more than streams, is at a stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flying hour is ever on her way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the fountain still supplies her store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wave behind impels the wave before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus in successive course the minutes run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And urge their predecessor minutes on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still moving, ever new; for former things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are set aside, like abdicated kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every moment alters what is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And innovates some act till then unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Darkness, we see, emerges into light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shining suns descend to sable night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even heaven itself receives another die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When wearied animals in slumbers lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of midnight ease; another, when the gray<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The disk of Ph&oelig;bus, when he climbs on high,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And when his chariot downward drives to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ball is with the same suffusion red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, mounted high in his meridian race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All bright he shines, and with a better face;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nor equal light the unequal moon adorns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in her wexing, or her waning horns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, every day she wanes, her face is less,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Time was, when we were sowed, and just began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some few fruitful drops, the promise of a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Nature's hand (fermented as it was)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moulded to shape the soft, coagulated mass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the little man was fully formed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breathless embryo with a spirit warmed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the mother's throes begin to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The creature, pent within the narrow room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks his blind prison, pushing to repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stifled breath, and draw the living air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast on the margin of the world he lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A helpless babe, but by instinct he cries.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He next essays to walk, but, downward pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On four feet imitates his brother beast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By slow degrees he gathers from the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His legs, and to the rolling chair is bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then walks alone: a horseman now become,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rides a stick, and travels round the room:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time he vaunts among his youthful peers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong-boned, and strung with nerves, in pride of years:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He runs with mettle his first merry stage,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Maintains the next, abated of his rage,      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But manages his strength, and spares his age.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy the third, and stiff, he sinks apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though 'tis down-hill all, but creeps along the race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sapless on the verge of death he stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contemplating his former feet, and hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, Milo-like, his slackened sinews sees,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And withered arms, once fit to cope with Hercules,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Unable now to shake, much less to tear, the trees.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">So Helen wept, when her too faithful glass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflected to her eyes the ruins of her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering what charms her ravishers could spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To force her twice, or even but once enjoy!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy teeth, devouring time, thine, envious age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On things below still exercise your rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With venomed grinders you corrupt your meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, at lingering meals, the morsels eat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor those, which elements we call, abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to this figure, nor to that, are tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this eternal world is said of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But four prolific principles to hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four different bodies; two to heaven ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other two down to the centre tend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, first, with wings expanded mounts on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure, void of weight, and dwells in upper sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Air, because unclogged in empty space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flies after fire, and claims the second place;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But weighty Water, as her nature guides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies on the lap of Earth; and mother Earth subsides.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All things are mixt with these, which all contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into these are all resolved again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth rarifies to dew; expanded more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The subtle dew in air begins to soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreads as she flies, and, weary of her name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extenuates still, and changes into flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having by degrees perfection won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restless, they soon untwist the web they spun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fire begins to lose her radiant hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with gross air, and air descends to dew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dew, condensing, does her form forego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sinks, a heavy lump of earth, below.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus are their figures never at a stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But changed by Nature's innovating hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things are altered, nothing is destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shifted scene for some new show employed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, to be born, is to begin to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some other thing we were not formerly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what we call to die, is not to appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or be the thing that formerly we were.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those very elements, which we partake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alive, when dead, some other bodies make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Translated grow, have sense, or can discourse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But death on deathless substance has no force.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That forms are changed I grant, that nothing can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continue in the figure it began:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden age to silver was debased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To copper that; our metal came at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The face of places, and their forms, decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that is solid earth, that once was sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seas, in their turn, retreating from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make solid land what ocean was before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far from strands are shells of fishes found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rusty anchors fixed on mountain ground;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And what were fields before, now washed and worn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By falling floods from high, to valleys turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, crumbling still, descend to level lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lakes, and trembling bogs, are barren sands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the parched desert floats in streams unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering to drink of waters not her own.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here nature living fountains opes; and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seals up the wombs where living fountains were;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or earthquakes stop their ancient course, and bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diverted streams to feed a distant spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Lycus, swallowed up, is seen no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, far from thence, knocks out another door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Erasinus dives; and blind in earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs on, and gropes his way to second birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starts up in Argos meads, and shakes his locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the fields, and fattens all the flocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Mysus by another way is led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, grown a river, now disdains his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgets his humble birth, his name forsakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the proud title of Caicus takes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large Amenane, impure with yellow sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs rapid often, and as often stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here he threats the drunken fields to drown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there his dugs deny to give their liquor down.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Anigros once did wholesome draughts afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now his deadly waters are abhorred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, hurt by Hercules, as fame resounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Centaur<a id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in his current washed his wounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streams of Hypanis are sweet no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, brackish, lose their taste they had before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antissa, Pharos, Tyre, in seas were pent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once isles, but now increase the continent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the Leucadian coast, main-land before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By rushing seas is severed from the shore.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So Zancle to the Italian earth was tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men once walked where ships at anchor ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Neptune overlooked the narrow way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in disdain poured in the conquering sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two cities that adorned the Achaian ground,       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Buris and Helice, no more are found,              <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, whelmed beneath a lake, are sunk and drowned;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And boatmen through the crystal water show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wondering passengers, the walls below.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Near Tr&aelig;zen stands a hill, exposed in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To winter winds, of leafy shadows bare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This once was level ground; but (strange to tell)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The included vapours, that in caverns dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labouring with cholic pangs, and close confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain sought issue from the rumbling wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still they heaved for vent, and, heaving still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlarged the concave, and shot up the hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As breath extends a bladder, or the skins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of goats are blown to inclose the hoarded wines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain yet retains a mountain's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathered rubbish heals the hollow space.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of many wonders, which I heard or knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retrenching most, I will relate but few.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, are not springs with qualities opposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endued at seasons, and at seasons lost?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice in a day, thine, Ammon, change their form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold at high noon, at morn and evening warm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine, Athaman, will kindle wood, if thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the piled earth, and in the waning moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thracians have a stream, if any try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taste, his hardened bowels petrify;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er it touches it converts to stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes a marble pavement where it runs.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grathis, and Sibaris her sister flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slide through our Calabrian neighbour wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold and amber die the shining hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thither youth resort; for who would not be fair?<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But stranger virtues yet in streams we find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some change not only bodies, but the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has not heard of Salmacis obscene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose waters into women soften men?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of &AElig;thiopian lakes, which turn the brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To madness, or in heavy sleep constrain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clytorean streams the love of wine expel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such is the virtue of the abstemious well,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the colder nymph, that rules the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extinguishes, and baulks the drunken God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that Melampus (so have some assured)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the mad Pr&oelig;tides with charms he cured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And powerful herbs, both charms and simples cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the sober spring, where still their virtues last.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unlike effects Lyncestis will produce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who drinks his waters, though with moderate use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reels as with wine, and sees with double sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heels too heavy, and his head too light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ladon, once Pheneos, an Arcadian stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ambiguous in the effects, as in the name,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By day is wholesome beverage; but is thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night infected, and a deadly draught.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus running rivers, and the standing lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now of these virtues, now of those partake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time was (and all things time and fate obey)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fast Ortygia floated on the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such were Cyanean isles, when Typhis steered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt their straits, and their collision feared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They swam where now they sit; and, firmly joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure of rooting up, resist the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor &AElig;tna, vomiting sulphureous fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ever belch; for sulphur will expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veins exhausted of the liquid store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time was she cast no flames; in time will cast no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For, whether earth's an animal, and air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imbibes, her lungs with coolness to repair,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And what she sucks remits, she still requires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inlets for air, and outlets for her fires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When tortured with convulsive fits she shakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That motion chokes the vent, till other vent she makes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when the winds in hollow caves are closed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And subtile spirits find that way opposed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They toss up flints in air; the flints that hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seeds of fire, thus tossed in air, collide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindling the sulphur, till, the fuel spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cave is cooled, and the fierce winds relent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether sulphur, catching fire, feeds on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its unctuous parts, till, all the matter gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flames no more ascend; for earth supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fat that feeds them; and when earth denies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That food, by length of time consumed, the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famished for want of fuel, must expire.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A race of men there are, as fame has told,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he was doubtful of his future fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O goddess born, with thy hard fortune strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy never can be lost, and thou alive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy passage thou shalt free through fire and sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy in foreign lands shall be restored.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In happier fields a rising town I see,                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Greater than what e'er was, or is, or e'er shall be;   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven yet owes the world a race derived from thee.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sages and chiefs, of other lineage born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city shall extend, extended shall adorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from Iulus he must draw his birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whom thy Rome shall rule the conquered earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom heaven will lend mankind on earth to reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late require the precious pledge again.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Helenus to great &AElig;neas told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I retain, e'er since in other mould<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul was clothed; and now rejoice to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My country walls rebuilt, and Troy revived anew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised by the fall; decreed by loss to gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enslaved but to be free, and conquered but to reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis time my hard-mouthed coursers to controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apt to run riot, and transgress the goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore I conclude: whatever lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In earth, or flits in air, or fills the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All suffer change; and we, that are of soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And body mixed, are members of the whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when our sires, or grandsires, shall forsake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forms of men, and brutal figures take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus housed, securely let their spirits rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor violate thy father in the beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy friend, thy brother, any of thy kin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If none of these, yet there's a man within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O spare to make a Thyestean meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To inclose his body, and his soul expel.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ill customs by degrees to habits rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill habits soon become exalted vice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What more advance can mortals make in sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near perfection, who with blood begin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deaf to the calf that lies beneath the knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks up, and from her butcher begs her life;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Deaf to the harmless kid, that, ere he dies,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All methods to procure thy mercy tries,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And imitates in vain thy children's cries.  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where will he stop, who feeds with household bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then eats the poultry, which before he fed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let plough thy steers; that, when they lose their breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To nature, not to thee, they may impute their death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let goats for food their loaded udders lend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheep from winter-cold thy sides defend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neither springes, nets, nor snares employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be no more ingenious to destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free as in air, let birds on earth remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let insidious glue their wings constrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor opening hounds the trembling stag affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor purple feathers intercept his flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hooks concealed in baits for fish prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lines to heave them twinkling up in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take not away the life you cannot give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all things have an equal right to live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kill noxious creatures, where 'tis sin to save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This only just prerogative we have:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nourish life with vegetable food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shun the sacrilegious taste of blood.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These precepts by the Samian sage were taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which godlike Numa to the Sabines brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence transferred to Rome, by gift his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A willing people, and an offered throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O happy monarch, sent by heaven to bless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A savage nation with soft arts of peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To teach religion, rapine to restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give laws to lust, and sacrifice ordain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself a saint, a goddess was his bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the muses o'er his acts preside.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Cupid's school whoe'er would take degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must learn his rudiments, by reading me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seamen with sailing arts their vessels move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art guides the chariot, art instructs to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ships and chariots others know the rule;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I am master in Love's mighty school.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cupid indeed is obstinate and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stubborn god, but yet the god's a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easy to govern in his tender age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like fierce Achilles in his pupillage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hero, born for conquest, trembling stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the Centaur, and received the rod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Chiron mollified his cruel mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With art, and taught his warlike hands to wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silver strings of his melodious lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Love's fair goddess does my soul inspire,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To teach her softer arts, to sooth the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth the rugged breasts of human kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet Cupid and Achilles, each with scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rage were filled, and both were goddess-born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bull, reclaimed and yoked, the burden draws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horse receives the bitt within his jaws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stubborn Love shall bend beneath my sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though struggling oft he strives to disobey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shakes his torch, he wounds me with his darts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vain his force, and vainer are his arts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more he burns my soul, or wounds my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more he teaches to revenge the spite.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I boast no aid the Delphian god affords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor auspice from the flight of chattering birds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Clio, nor her sisters, have I seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Hesiod saw them on the shady green:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Experience makes my work; a truth so tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may believe, and Venus be my guide.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far hence, ye vestals, be, who bind your hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wives, who gowns below your ancles wear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sing the brothels loose and unconfined, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The unpunishable pleasures of the kind;   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which all alike, for love, or money, find.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">You, who in Cupid's rolls inscribe your name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First seek an object worthy of your flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then strive, with art, your lady's mind to gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, last, provide your love may long remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On these three precepts all my works shall move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the rules and principles of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before your youth with marriage is opprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make choice of one who suits your humour best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a damsel drops not from the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She must be sought for with a curious eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wary angler, in the winding brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows what the fish, and where to bait his hook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fowler and the huntsman know by name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The certain haunts and harbour of their game.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So must the lover beat the likeliest grounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The assembly where his quarry most abounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall my novice wander far astray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These rules shall put him in the ready way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt not sail around the continent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As far as Perseus, or as Paris went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Rome alone affords thee such a store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all the world can hardly show thee more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of heaven with fewer stars is crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than beauties in the Roman sphere are found.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether thy love is bent on blooming youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On dawning sweetness in unartful truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or courts the juicy joys of riper growth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here may'st thou find thy full desires in both.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if autumnal beauties please thy sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(An age that knows to give, and take delight,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions of matrons of the graver sort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In common prudence, will not baulk the sport.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In summer heats thou need'st but only go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pompey's cool and shady portico;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Concord's fane; or that proud edifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose turrets near the bawdy suburb rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to that other portico, where stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruel father urging his commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fifty daughters wait the time of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plunge their poniards in the bridegroom's breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Venus' temple, where, on annual nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mourn Adonis with Assyrian rites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shun the Jewish walk, where the foul drove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Sabbaths, rest from every thing but love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Isis' temple; for that sacred whore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes others what to Jove she was before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the hall itself be not belied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even there the cause of love is often tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near it at least, or in the palace-yard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whence the noisy combatants are heard.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The crafty counsellors, in formal gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There gain another's cause, but lose their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There eloquence is nonplust in the suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lawyers, who had words at will, are mute.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus, from her adjoining temple, smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see them caught in their litigious wiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave senators lead home the youthful dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning clients, when they patrons came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, above all, the play-house is the place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's choice of quarry in that narrow chace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There take thy stand, and, sharply looking out,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Soon may'st thou find a mistress in the rout,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For length of time, or for a single bout.      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The theatres are berries for the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ants on mole-hills thither they repair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bees to hives, so numerously they throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be said, they to that place belong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither they swarm, who have the public voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There choose, if plenty not distracts thy choice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see, and to be seen, in heaps they run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some to undo, and some to be undone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From Romulus the rise of plays began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his new subjects a commodious man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, his unmarried soldiers to supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took care the commonwealth should multiply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Providing Sabine women for his braves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a true king, to get a race of slaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His play-house not of Parian marble made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was it spread with purple sails for shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stage with rushes, or with leaves, they strewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No scenes in prospect, no machining god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On rows of homely turf they sat to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with the wreaths of every common tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, while they sat in rustic majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each lover had his mistress in his eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whom he saw most suiting to his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For joys of matrimonial rape designed.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce could they wait the plaudit in their haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, ere the dances and the song were past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch gave the signal from his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rising, bade his merry men fall on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The martial crew, like soldiers ready prest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just at the word, (the word too was, "The best,")<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joyful cries each other animate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some choose, and some at hazard seize their mate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As doves from eagles, or from wolves the lambs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So from their lawless lovers fly the dames.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fear was one, but not one face of fear;      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some rend the lovely tresses of their hair;        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Some shriek, and some are struck with dumb despair.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her absent mother one invokes in vain;        <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">One stands amazed, not daring to complain;    <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The nimbler trust their feet, the slow remain.<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But nought availing, all are captives led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling and blushing, to the genial bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She who too long resisted, or denied,                  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The lusty lover made by force a bride;                 <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, with superior strength, compelled her to his side.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then soothed her thus:&mdash;My soul's far better part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cease weeping, nor afflict thy tender heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what thy father to thy mother was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That faith to thee, that solemn vow I pass.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus Romulus became so popular;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the way to thrive in peace and war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay his army, and fresh whores to bring,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would not fight for such a gracious king?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus love in theatres did first improve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And theatres are still the scenes of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shun the chariot's, and the courser's race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The circus is no inconvenient place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No need is there of talking on the hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor nods, nor signs, which lovers understand:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But boldly next the fair your seat provide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close as you can to hers, and side by side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased or unpleased, no matter, crowding sit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so the laws of public shows permit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then find occasion to begin discourse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inquire, whose chariot this, and whose that horse?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whatsoever side she is inclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suit all your inclinations to her mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like what she likes; from thence your court begin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whom she favours, wish that he may win.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the statues of the deities,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In chariots rolled, appear before the prize;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When Venus comes, with deep devotion rise.  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">If dust be on her lap, or grains of sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brush both away with your officious hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If none be there, yet brush that nothing thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still to touch her lap make some pretence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touch any thing of hers; and if her train     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep on the ground, let it not sweep in vain,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But gently take it up, and wipe it clean;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And while you wipe it, with observing eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows but you may see her naked thighs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observe, who sits behind her; and beware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest his encroaching knee should press the fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light service takes light minds; for some can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of favours won, by laying cushions well:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fanning faces, some their fortune meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some by laying footstools for their feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These overtures of love the circus gives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor at the sword-play less the lover thrives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there the son of Venus fights his prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deepest wounds are oft received from eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, while the crowd their acclamations make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or while he bets, and puts his ring to stake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is struck from far, and feels the flying dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the spectacle is made a part.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
<span class="i2">C&aelig;sar would represent a naval fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his own honour, and for Rome's delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From either sea the youths and maidens come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world was then contained in Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this vast concourse, in this choice of game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Roman heart but felt a foreign flame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more our prince prepares to make us glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the remaining East to Rome will add.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoice, ye Roman soldiers, in your urns;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Your ensigns from the Parthians shall return,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the slain Crassi shall no longer mourn.  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A youth is sent those trophies to demand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bears his father's thunder in his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubt not the imperial boy in wars unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In childhood all of C&aelig;sar's race are men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial seeds shoot out before their day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevent their years, and brook no dull delay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus infant Hercules the snakes did press,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his cradle did his sire confess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bacchus, a boy, yet like a hero fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And early spoils from conquered India brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus you your father's troops shall lead to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus shall vanquish in your father's right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These rudiments you to your lineage owe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born to encrease your titles, as you grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brethren you had, revenge your brethren slain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have a father, and his rights maintain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed by your country's parent, and your own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeem your country, and restore his throne.<br /></span>

<hr class="r20a" />

<p>For this last half year I have been troubled with the
disease (as I may call it) of translation. The cold prose
fits of it, which are always the most tedious with
me, were spent in the History of the League;<a id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the
hot, which succeeded them, in this volume of Verse
Miscellanies. The truth is, I fancied to myself a
kind of ease in the change of the paroxysm; never
suspecting but that the humour would have wasted
itself in two or three pastorals of Theocritus, and as
many odes of Horace. But finding, or at least thinking
I found, something that was more pleasing in
them than my ordinary productions, I encouraged
myself to renew my old acquaintance with Lucretius
and Virgil; and immediately fixed upon some parts
of them, which had most affected me in the reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>These were my natural impulses for the undertaking.
But there was an accidental motive which
was full as forcible, and God forgive him who was
the occasion of it. It was my Lord Roscommon's
"Essay on Translated Verse;"<a id="FNanchor_AV_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which made me
uneasy till I tried whether or no I was capable
of following his rules, and of reducing the speculation
into practice. For, many a fair precept in poetry
is, like a seeming demonstration in the mathematics,
very specious in the diagram, but failing in
the mechanic operation. I think I have generally
observed his instructions; I am sure my reason is
sufficiently convinced both of their truth and usefulness;
which, in other words, is to confess no
less a vanity, than to pretend that I have, at least
in some places, made examples to his rules. Yet,
withal, I must acknowledge, that I have many
times exceeded my commission; for I have both
added and omitted, and even sometimes very boldly
made such expositions of my author's, as no
Dutch commentator will forgive me. Perhaps, in
such particular passages, I have thought that I discovered
some beauty yet undiscovered by those pedants,
which none but a poet could have found.
Where I have taken away some of their expressions,
and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this
consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek
or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English:
and where I have enlarged them, I desire
the false critics would not always think, that those
thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are
secretly in the poet, or may be fairly deduced from
him; or at least, if both those considerations should
fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if
he were living, and an Englishman, they are such
as he would probably have written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>For, after all, a translator is to make his author
appear as charming as possibly he can, provided he
maintains his character, and makes him not unlike
himself. Translation is a kind of drawing after the
life; where every one will acknowledge there is a
double sort of likeness, a good one and a bad. It
is one thing to draw the outlines true, the features
like, the proportions exact, the colouring itself perhaps
tolerable; and another thing to make all these
graceful, by the posture, the shadowings, and, chiefly,
by the spirit which animates the whole. I cannot,
without some indignation, look on an ill copy
of an excellent original; much less can I behold
with patience Virgil, Homer, and some others, whose
beauties I have been endeavouring all my life to
imitate, so abused, as I may say, to their faces, by a
botching interpreter. What English readers, unacquainted
with Greek or Latin, will believe me, or
any other man, when we commend those authors,
and confess we derive all that is pardonable in us
from their fountains, if they take those to be the
same poets, whom our Oglebies have translated?
But I dare assure them, that a good poet is no more
like himself, in a dull translation, than his carcase
would be to his living body. There are many, who
understand Greek and Latin, and yet are ignorant
of their mother-tongue. The proprieties and delicacies
of the English are known to few; it is impossible
even for a good wit to understand and
practise them, without the help of a liberal education,
long reading, and digesting of those few
good authors we have amongst us, the knowledge
of men and manners, the freedom of habitudes and
conversation with the best company of both sexes;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and, in short, without wearing off the rust which
he contracted while he was laying in a stock of
learning. Thus difficult it is to understand the purity
of English, and critically to discern not only
good writers from bad, and a proper style from a
corrupt, but also to distinguish that which is pure in
a good author, from that which is vicious and corrupt
in him. And for want of all these requisites,
or the greatest part of them, most of our ingenious
young men take up some cried-up English poet for
their model, adore him, and imitate him, as they
think, without knowing wherein he is defective,
where he is boyish and trifling, wherein either his
thoughts are improper to his subject, or his expressions
unworthy of his thoughts, or the turn of both
is unharmonious. Thus it appears necessary, that a
man should be a nice critic in his mother-tongue,
before he attempts to translate in a foreign language.
Neither is it sufficient, that he be able to judge
of words and style; but he must be a master of
them too; he must perfectly understand his author's
tongue, and absolutely command his own.
So that, to be a thorough translator, he must be
a thorough poet. Neither is it enough to give his
author's sense in good English, in poetical expressions,
and in musical numbers; for, though all these
are exceeding difficult to perform, there yet remains
a harder task; and it is a secret of which few
translators have sufficiently thought. I have already
hinted a word or two concerning it; that is,
the maintaining the character of an author, which
distinguishes him from all others, and makes him
appear that individual poet whom you would interpret.
For example, not only the thoughts, but the
style and versification, of Virgil and Ovid are very
different: Yet I see, even in our best poets, who
have translated some parts of them, that they have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
confounded their several talents; and, by endeavouring
only at the sweetness and harmony of numbers,
have made them both so much alike, that,
if I did not know the originals, I should never be
able to judge by the copies, which was Virgil, and
which was Ovid. It was objected against a late
noble painter,<a id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that he drew many graceful pictures,
but few of them were alike. And this happened
to him, because he always studied himself
more than those who sat to him. In such translators
I can easily distinguish the hand which performed
the work, but I cannot distinguish their
poet from another. Suppose two authors are equally
sweet, yet there is as great distinction to be made
in sweetness, as in that of sugar, and that of honey.
I can make the difference more plain, by giving you
(if it be worth knowing) my own method of proceeding,
in my translations out of four several poets
in this volume; Virgil, Theocritus, Lucretius, and
Horace. In each of these, before I undertook them,
I considered the genius and distinguishing character
of my author. I looked on Virgil as a succinct,
and grave majestic writer; one who weighed, not
only every thought, but every word and syllable;
who was still aiming to crowd his sense into as narrow
a compass as possibly he could; for which reason
he is so very figurative, that he requires (I may
almost say) a grammar apart to construe him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>His verse is every where sounding the very thing in
your ears, whose sense it bears; yet the numbers
are perpetually varied, to increase the delight of the
reader; so that the same sounds are never repeated
twice together. On the contrary, Ovid and Claudian,
though they write in styles differing from each other,
yet have each of them but one sort of music in their
verses. All the versification and little variety of
Claudian is included within the compass of four or
five lines, and then he begins again in the same tenor;
perpetually closing his sense at the end of a
verse, and that verse commonly which they call golden,
or two substantives and two adjectives, with a
verb betwixt them to keep the peace. Ovid, with
all his sweetness, has as little variety of numbers
and sound as he: he is always, as it were, upon the
hand-gallop, and his verse runs upon carpet-ground.
He avoids, like the other, all synal&aelig;phas, or cutting
off one vowel when it comes before another in the
following word; so that, minding only smoothness,
he wants both variety and majesty.&mdash;But to return to
Virgil: though he is smooth where smoothness is required,
yet he is so far from affecting it, that he seems
rather to disdain it; frequently makes use of synal&aelig;phas,
and concludes his sense in the middle of
his verse. He is every where above conceits of
epigrammatic wit, and gross hyperboles; he maintains
majesty in the midst of plainness; he shines,
but glares not; and is stately without ambition,
which is the vice of Lucan. I drew my definition
of poetical wit from my particular consideration of
him: for propriety of thoughts and words are only
to be found in him; and, where they are proper,
they will be delightful. Pleasure follows of necessity,
as the effect does the cause; and therefore is
not to be put into the definition. This exact propriety
of Virgil I particularly regarded, as a great
part of his character; but must confess, to my
shame, that I have not been able to translate any
part of him so well, as to make him appear wholly
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
like himself: for, where the original is close, no
version can reach it in the same compass. Hannibal
Caro's,<a id="FNanchor_AX_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in the Italian, is the nearest, the most
poetical, and the most sonorous of any translation
of the &AElig;neids; yet, though he takes the advantage
of blank verse, he commonly allows two lines for
one of Virgil, and does not always hit his sense.
Tasso tells us, in his letters, that Sperone Speroni,
a great Italian wit, who was his contemporary,
observed of Virgil and Tully, that the Latin orator
endeavoured to imitate the copiousness of Homer,
the Greek poet; and that the Latin poet made
it his business to reach the conciseness of Demosthenes,
the Greek orator. Virgil therefore, being
so very sparing of his words, and leaving so much
to be imagined by the reader, can never be translated
as he ought, in any modern tongue. To make
him copious, is to alter his character; and to translate
him line for line, is impossible; because the
Latin is naturally a more succinct language than
either the Italian, Spanish, French, or even than
the English, which, by reason of its monosyllables,
is far the most compendious of them. Virgil is
much the closest of any Roman poet, and the Latin
hexameter has more feet than the English heroick.</p>

<p>Besides all this, an author has the choice of his
own thoughts and words, which a translator has
not; he is confined by the sense of the inventor to
those expressions which are the nearest to it: so
that Virgil, studying brevity, and having the command
of his own language, could bring those words
into a narrow compass, which a translator cannot
render without circumlocutions. In short, they,
who have called him the torture of grammarians,
might also have called him the plague of translators;
for he seems to have studied not to be translated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>I own that, endeavouring to turn his "Nisus
and Euryalus" as close as I was able, I have performed
that episode too literally; that, giving more
scope to "Mezentius and Lausus," that version, which
has more of the majesty of Virgil, has less of his
conciseness; and all that I can promise for myself,
is only, that I have done both better than Ogleby,
and perhaps as well as Caro; so that, methinks, I
come like a malefactor, to make a speech upon the
gallows, and to warn all other poets, by my sad example,
from the sacrilege of translating Virgil. Yet,
by considering him so carefully as I did before my
attempt, I have made some faint resemblance of
him; and, had I taken more time, might possibly
have succeeded better; but never so well as to have
satisfied myself.</p>

<p>He who excels all other poets in his own language,
were it possible to do him right, must appear
above them in our tongue, which, as my Lord Roscommon
justly observes, approaches nearest to the
Roman in its majesty; nearest indeed, but with a
vast interval betwixt them. There is an inimitable
grace in Virgil's words, and in them principally
consists that beauty, which gives so inexpressible a
pleasure to him who best understands their force.
This diction of his (I must once again say) is never
to be copied; and, since it cannot, he will appear
but lame in the best translation. The turns of his
verse, his breakings, his propriety, his numbers, and
his gravity, I have as far imitated, as the poverty of
our language, and the hastiness of my performance,
would allow. I may seem sometimes to have varied
from his sense; but I think the greatest variations
may be fairly deduced from him; and where I
leave his commentators, it may be I understand him
better: at least I writ without consulting them in
many places. But two particular lines in Mezentius
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and Lausus, I cannot so easily excuse. They are
indeed remotely allied to Virgil's sense; but they
are too like the trifling tenderness of Ovid, and were
printed before I had considered them enough to
alter them. The first of them I have forgotten, and
cannot easily retrieve, because the copy is at the
press. The second is this:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Lausus died, I was already slain.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This appears pretty enough at first sight; but I
am convinced, for many reasons, that the expression
is too bold; that Virgil would not have said it,
though Ovid would. The reader may pardon it, if
he please, for the freeness of the confession; and
instead of that, and the former, admit these two
lines, which are more according to the author:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I had used my fortune, use thou thine.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Having with much ado got clear of Virgil, I
have, in the next place, to consider the genius of
Lucretius, whom I have translated more happily in
those parts of him which I undertook. If he was
not of the best age of Roman poetry, he was at
least of that which preceded it;<a id="FNanchor_AY_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and he himself
refined it to that degree of perfection, both in the
language and the thoughts, that he left an easy
task to Virgil; who, as he succeeded him in time, so
he copied his excellencies; for the method of the
Georgics is plainly derived from him. Lucretius
had chosen a subject naturally crabbed; he therefore
adorned it with poetical descriptions, and precepts
of morality, in the beginning and ending of
his books, which you see Virgil has imitated with
great success in those four books, which, in my opinion,
are more perfect in their kind than even his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
divine &AElig;neids. The turn of his verses he has likewise
followed in those places which Lucretius has
most laboured, and some of his very lines he has
transplanted into his own works, without much variation.
If I am not mistaken, the distinguishing
character of Lucretius (I mean of his soul and
genius) is a certain kind of noble pride, and positive
assertion of his opinions. He is every where confident
of his own reason, and assuming an absolute
command, not only over his vulgar reader, but
even his patron Memmius. For he is always bidding
him attend, as if he had the rod over him; and
using a magisterial authority, while he instructs
him. From his time to ours, I know none so like
him, as our poet and philosopher of Malmesbury.<a id="FNanchor_AZ_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
This is that perpetual dictatorship, which is exercised
by Lucretius; who, though often in the wrong,
yet seems to deal <i>bon&#515; fide</i> with his reader, and tells
him nothing but what he thinks; in which plain
sincerity, I believe, he differs from our Hobbes, who
could not but be convinced, or at least doubt of
some eternal truths, which he has opposed. But
for Lucretius, he seems to disdain all manner of
replies, and is so confident of his cause, that he is
beforehand with his antagonists; urging for them
whatever he imagined they could say, and leaving
them, as he supposes, without an objection for the
future: all this, too, with so much scorn and indignation,
as if he were assured of the triumph, before
he entered into the lists. From this sublime and
daring genius of his, it must of necessity come to
pass, that his thoughts must be masculine, full of argumentation,
and that sufficiently warm. From the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
same fiery temper proceeds the loftiness of his expressions,
and the perpetual torrent of his verse,
where the barrenness of his subject does not too
much constrain the quickness of his fancy. For there
is no doubt to be made, but that he could have been
every where as poetical, as he is in his descriptions,
and in the moral part of his philosophy, if he had
not aimed more to instruct, in his system of nature,
than to delight. But he was bent upon making
Memmius a materialist, and teaching him to defy
an invisible power: in short, he was so much an
atheist, that he forgot sometimes to be a poet.
These are the considerations, which I had of that
author, before I attempted to translate some parts
of him. And accordingly I laid by my natural diffidence
and scepticism for a while, to take up that
dogmatical way of his, which, as I said, is so much
his character, as to make him that individual poet.
As for his opinions concerning the mortality of the
soul, they are so absurd, that I cannot, if I would,
believe them. I think a future state demonstrable
even by natural arguments; at least, to take away
rewards and punishments is only a pleasing prospect
to a man, who resolves beforehand not to live morally.
But, on the other side, the thought of being
nothing after death is a burthen insupportable to a
virtuous man, even though a heathen. We naturally
aim at happiness, and cannot bear to have it
confined to the shortness of our present being; especially
when we consider, that virtue is generally
unhappy in this world, and vice fortunate: so that
it is hope of futurity alone, that makes this life tolerable,
in expectation of a better. Who would not
commit all the excesses, to which he is prompted by
his natural inclinations, if he may do them with security
while he is alive, and be incapable of punishment
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
after he is dead? If he be cunning and secret
enough to avoid the laws, there is no band of
morality to restrain him: for fame and reputation
are weak ties; many men have not the least sense
of them. Powerful men are only awed by them, as
they conduce to their interest, and that not always,
when a passion is predominant; and no man will be
contained within the bounds of duty, when he may
safely transgress them. These are my thoughts abstractedly,
and without entering into the notions of
our Christian faith, which is the proper business of
divines.</p>

<p>But there are other arguments in this poem
(which I have turned into English) not belonging
to the mortality of the soul, which are strong
enough to a reasonable man, to make him less in
love with life, and consequently in less apprehensions
of death. Such as are the natural satiety proceeding
from a perpetual enjoyment of the same
things; the inconveniences of old age, which make
him incapable of corporeal pleasures; the decay of
understanding and memory, which render him contemptible,
and useless to others. These, and many
other reasons, so pathetically urged, so beautifully
expressed so adorned with examples, and so admirably
raised by the <i>prosopopeia</i> of Nature, who is
brought in speaking to her children with so much
authority and vigour, deserve the pains I have taken
with them, which I hope have not been unsuccessful,
or unworthy of my author: at least I must
take the liberty to own, that I was pleased with my
own endeavours, which but rarely happens to me;
and that I am not dissatisfied upon the review of
any thing I have done in this author.</p>

<p>It is true, there is something, and that of some
moment, to be objected against my englishing the
Nature of Love, from the fourth book of Lucretius;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and I can less easily answer why I translated it,
than why I thus translated it. The objection arises
from the obscenity of the subject; which is aggravated
by the too lively and alluring delicacy of the
verses. In the first place, without the least formality
of an excuse, I own it pleased me; and let my
enemies make the worst they can of this confession.
I am not yet so secure from that passion, but
that I want my author's antidotes against it. He
has given the truest and most philosophical account,
both of the disease and remedy, which I ever found
in any author; for which reasons I translated him.
But it will be asked, why I turned him into this
luscious English, for I will not give it a worse
word. Instead of an answer, I would ask again
of my supercilious adversaries, whether I am not
bound, when I translate an author, to do him all
the right I can, and to translate him to the best
advantage?  If, to mince his meaning, which I am
satisfied was honest and instructive, I had either
omitted some part of what he said, or taken from
the strength of his expression, I certainly had wronged
him; and that freeness of thought and words
being thus cashiered in my hands, he had no longer
been Lucretius. If nothing of this kind be to be
read, physicians must not study nature, anatomies
must not be seen, and somewhat I could say of particular
passages in books, which, to avoid profaneness,
I do not name. But the intention qualifies
the act; and both mine and my author's were to
instruct, as well as please. It is most certain, that
bare-faced bawdry is the poorest pretence to wit
imaginable. If I should say otherwise, I should
have two great authorities against me: the one is
the "Essay on Poetry," which I publicly valued
before I knew the author of it, and with the commendation
of which my Lord Roscommon so happily
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
begins his "Essay on Translated Verse;" the
other is no less than our admired Cowley, who says
the same thing in other words; for, in his "Ode
concerning Wit," he writes thus of it:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Much less can that have any place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At which a virgin hides her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The author blush, there, where the reader must.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Here indeed Mr Cowley goes farther than the
Essay; for he asserts plainly, that obscenity has no
place in wit; the other only says, it is a poor pretence
to it, or an ill sort of wit, which has nothing
more to support it than bare-faced ribaldry; which
is both unmannerly in itself, and fulsome to the
reader. But neither of these will reach my case:
for, in the first place, I am only the translator, not
the inventor; so that the heaviest part of the censure
falls upon Lucretius, before it reaches me: in
the next place, neither he nor I have used the grossest
words, but the cleanliest metaphors we could
find, to palliate the broadness of the meaning; and,
to conclude, have carried the poetical part no farther,
than the philosophical exacted.<a id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>There is one mistake of mine, which I will not
lay to the printer's charge, who has enough to answer
for in false pointings; it is in the word, <i>viper</i>:
I would have the verse run thus:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The scorpion, love, must on the wound be bruised.<a id="FNanchor_BB_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a sort of blundering, half-witted people,
who make a great deal of noise about a verbal
slip; though Horace would instruct them better in
true criticism:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i>non ego paucis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Offendar maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aut humana par&ugrave;m cavit natura.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>True judgment in poetry, like that in painting,
takes a view of the whole together, whether it be
good or not; and where the beauties are more than
the faults, concludes for the poet against the little
judge. It is a sign that malice is hard driven,
when it is forced to lay hold on a word or syllable:
to arraign a man is one thing, and to cavil at him
is another. In the midst of an ill-natured generation
of scribblers, there is always justice enough left
in mankind, to protect good writers: and they too
are obliged, both by humanity and interest, to espouse
each other's cause, against false critics, who
are the common enemies. This last consideration
puts me in mind of what I owe to the ingenious
and learned translator of Lucretius.<a id="FNanchor_BC_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> I have not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
here designed to rob him of any part of that
commendation which he has so justly acquired by
the whole author, whose fragments only fall to my
portion. What I have now performed is no more
than I intended above twenty years ago. The
ways of our translation are very different. He
follows him more closely than I have done, which
became an interpreter of the whole poem: I take
more liberty, because it best suited with my design,
which was, to make him as pleasing as I could. He
had been too voluminous, had he used my method
in so long a work; and I had certainly taken his,
had I made it my business to translate the whole.
The preference, then, is justly his; and I join with
Mr Evelyn in the confession of it, with this additional
advantage to him, that his reputation is already
established in this poet, mine is to make its
fortune in the world. If I have been any where
obscure, in following our common author, or if Lucretius
himself is to be condemned, I refer myself to
his excellent annotations, which I have often read,
and always with some new pleasure.</p>

<p>My preface begins already to swell upon me, and
looks as if I were afraid of my reader, by so tedious
a bespeaking of him; and yet I have Horace and
Theocritus upon my hands; but the Greek gentleman
shall quickly be dispatched, because I have
more business with the Roman.</p>

<p>That which distinguishes Theocritus from all
other poets, both Greek and Latin, and which raises
him even above Virgil in his Eclogues, is the inimitable
tenderness of his passions, and the natural
expression of them in words so becoming of a pastoral.
A simplicity shines through all he writes.
He shows his art and learning, by disguising both.
His shepherds never rise above their country education
in their complaints of love. There is the same
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
difference betwixt him and Virgil, as there is betwixt
Tasso's "Aminta" and the "Pastor Fido" of Guarini.
Virgil's shepherds are too well read in the philosophy
of Epicurus and of Plato, and Guarini's seem to have
been bred in courts; but Theocritus and Tasso have
taken theirs from cottages and plains. It was said
of Tasso, in relation to his similitudes, <i>mai esce del
bosco</i>, that he never departed from the woods; that
is all his comparisons were taken from the country.
The same may be said of our Theocritus. He is
softer than Ovid: he touches the passions more delicately,
and performs all this out of his own fund,
without diving into the arts and sciences for a supply.
Even his Doric dialect has an incomparable
sweetness in its clownishness, like a fair shepherdess
in her country russet, talking in a Yorkshire
tone. This was impossible for Virgil to imitate;
because the severity of the Roman language denied
him that advantage. Spenser has endeavoured it in
his "Shepherd's Calendar;" but neither will it succeed
in English; for which reason I forbore to attempt
it. For Theocritus writ to Sicilians, who
spoke that dialect; and I direct this part of my
translations to our ladies, who neither understand,
nor will take pleasure in such homely expressions.
I proceed to Horace.</p>

<p>Take him in parts, and he is chiefly to be considered
in his three different talents, as he was a
critic, a satirist, and a writer of odes. His morals
are uniform, and run through all of them; for, let
his Dutch commentators say what they will, his philosophy
was Epicurean; and he made use of gods
and providence only to serve a turn in poetry. But
since neither his Criticisms, which are the most instructive
of any that are written in this art, nor his
Satires, which are incomparably beyond Juvenal's, (if
to laugh and rally is to be preferred to railing and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
declaiming,) are no part of my present undertaking,
I confine myself wholly to his Odes. These are
also of several sorts: some of them are panegyrical,
others moral, the rest jovial, or (if I may so call
them) Bacchanalian. As difficult as he makes it,
and as indeed it is, to imitate Pindar, yet, in his
most elevated flights, and in the sudden changes of
his subject with almost imperceptible connections,
that Theban poet is his master. But Horace is of
the more bounded fancy, and confines himself
strictly to one sort of verse, or stanza, in every Ode.
That which will distinguish his style from all other
poets, is the elegance of his words, and the numerousness
of his verse. There is nothing so delicately
turned in all the Roman language. There appears
in every part of his diction, or (to speak English) in
all his expressions, a kind of noble and bold purity.
His words are chosen with as much exactness as
Virgil's; but there seems to be a greater spirit in
them. There is a secret happiness attends his
choice, which in Petronius is called <i>curiosa felicitas</i>,
and which I suppose he had from the <i>feliciter
audere</i> of Horace himself. But the most distinguishing
part of all his character seems to me to be his
briskness, his jollity, and his good humour; and
those I have chiefly endeavoured to copy. His
other excellencies, I confess, are above my imitation.
One Ode, which infinitely pleased me in the reading,
I have attempted to translate in Pindaric verse:
it is that, which is inscribed to the present Earl of
Rochester, to whom I have particular obligations,
which this small testimony of my gratitude can
never pay.<a  id="FNanchor_BD_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It is his darling in the Latin, and I
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
have taken some pains to make it my master-piece
in English; for which reason I took this kind of
verse, which allows more latitude than any other.
Every one knows it was introduced into our language,
in this age, by the happy genius of Mr
Cowley. The seeming easiness of it has made it
spread; but it has not been considered enough, to
be so well cultivated. It languishes in almost every
hand but his, and some very few, whom (to keep
the rest in countenance) I do not name. He, indeed,
has brought it as near perfection as was possible in
so short a time. But, if I may be allowed to speak
my mind modestly, and without injury to his sacred
ashes, somewhat of the purity of English, somewhat
of more equal thoughts, somewhat of sweetness
in the numbers, in one word, somewhat of a
finer turn, and more lyrical verse, is yet wanting.
As for the soul of it, which consists in the warmth
and vigour of fancy, the masterly figures, and the
copiousness of imagination, he has excelled all
others in this kind. Yet if the kind itself be capable
of more perfection, though rather in the ornamental
parts of it than the essential, what rules of
morality or respect have I broken, in naming the
defects, that they may hereafter be amended? Imitation
is a nice point, and there are few poets who
deserve to be models in all they write. Milton's
"Paradise Lost" is admirable; but am I therefore
bound to maintain, that there are no flats amongst
his elevations, when it is evident he creeps along
sometimes for above an hundred lines together?
Cannot I admire the height of his invention, and
the strength of his expression, without defending
his antiquated words, and the perpetual harshness
of their sound? It is as much commendation as a
man can bear, to own him excellent; all beyond it
is idolatry. Since Pindar was the prince of lyric
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
poets, let me have leave to say, that, in imitating
him, our numbers should, for the most part, be lyrical:
for variety, or rather where the majesty of
thought requires it, they may be stretched to the
English heroick of five feet, and to the French Alexandrine
of six. But the ear must preside, and direct
the judgment to the choice of numbers. Without
the nicety of this, the harmony of Pindaric verse
can never be complete; the cadency of one line
must be a rule to that of the next; and the sound
of the former must slide gently into that which follows,
without leaping from one extreme into another.
It must be done like the shadowings of a
picture, which fall by degrees into a darker colour.
I shall be glad, if I have so explained myself as to be
understood; but if I have not, <i>quod nequeo dicere, et
sentio tantum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> must be my excuse.</p>

<p>There remains much more to be said on this subject;
but, to avoid envy, I will be silent. What I
have said is the general opinion of the best judges,
and in a manner has been forced from me, by seeing
a noble sort of poetry so happily restored by
one man, and so grossly copied by almost all the
rest. A musical ear, and a great genius, if another
Mr Cowley could arise in another age, may bring
it to perfection. In the mean time,</p>

<p>I hope it will not be expected from me, that I
should say any thing of my fellow undertakers in
this Miscellany. Some of them are too nearly
related to me, to be commended without suspicion
of partiality;<a id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> others I am sure need it not; and
the rest I have not perused.</p>

<p>To conclude, I am sensible that I have written this
too hastily and too loosely; I fear I have been tedious,
and, which is worse, it comes out from the first
draught, and uncorrected. This I grant is no excuse;
for it may be reasonably urged, why did he
not write with more leisure, or, if he had it not,
(which was certainly my case,) why did he attempt
to write on so nice a subject? The objection
is unanswerable; but, in part of recompence, let me
assure the reader, that, in hasty productions, he is
sure to meet with an author's present sense, which
cooler thoughts would possibly have disguised.
There is undoubtedly more of spirit, though not of
judgment, in these uncorrect essays; and consequently,
though my hazard be the greater, yet the reader's
pleasure is not the less.</p>

born in 1659, and in June 1700 committed suicide; for which
rash action no adequate cause has been assigned. Besides the
translation of Lucretius, which is his principal work, he executed
an indifferent version of Horace, and translated parts of
Theocritus, Ovid, Juvenal, Virgil, &amp;c. In his translation of Lucretius,
he omitted the indelicate part of the Fourth Book; a deficiency
which Dryden thought fit to supply, for which he has
above assigned some very inadequate reasons. Creech's Lucretius
first appeared at Oxford, in 8vo, 1682, and was reprinted
in the year following. The annotations, to which our author alludes
a little lower, were originally attached to a Latin edition of
Lucretius, superintended by Creech, and afterwards transferred to
his English version. They display great learning, and an intimate
acquaintance with the Epicurean philosophy.</p></div>

<span class="i0">Your nameless beauties nakedly displayed?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My heart maintains for both a double flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieved, but unmoved, and patient of your scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So faithful I, and you so much forsworn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I die, and death will finish all my pain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How ruddy, like your lips, their streaks appear!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon the topmost branch (the tree was high);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nimbly up, from bough to bough, I swerved,<a id="FNanchor_BH_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for to-morrow have ten more reserved.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The heavy hand it bears on human kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The milk of tygers was his infant food,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">I rave, and in my raging fit shall tear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I tried the infallible prophetic way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poppy-leaf upon my palm to lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I struck, and yet no lucky crack did follow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I struck hard, and yet the leaf lay hollow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, which was worse, if any worse could prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The withering leaf foreshowed your withering love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet farther,&mdash;ah, how far a lover dares!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My last recourse I had to sieve and sheers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told the witch Agreo my disease:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Agreo, that in harvest used to lease;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, foaming with her God, foretold my fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I was doomed to love, and you to hate.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet some suppose 'twas love, (some few indeed!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stopt the fatal fury of her speed:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No kiss, no look, to cheer the drooping boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No word she spoke, she scorned even to deny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as a hunted panther casts about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her glaring eyes, and pricks her listening ears to scout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So she, to shun his toils, her cares employed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiercely in her savage freedom joyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mouth she writhed, her forehead taught to frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes to sparkle fires to love unknown;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her sallow cheeks her envious mind did shew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every feature spoke aloud the curstness of a shrew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet could not he his obvious fate escape;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His love still dressed her in a pleasing shape;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every sullen frown, and bitter scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fanned the fuel that too fast did burn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time, unequal to his mighty pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strove to curb it, but he strove in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last his woes broke out, and begged relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears, the dumb petitioners of grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears so tender, as adorned his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And any heart, but only hers, would move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling before her bolted doors he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there poured out the unprofitable flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staring his eyes, and hagard was his look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, kissing first the threshold, thus he spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah nymph, more cruel than of human race!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy tygress heart belies thy angel face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too well thou show'st thy pedigree from stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy grandame's was the first by Pyrrha thrown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unworthy thou to be so long desired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so my love, and so my fate required.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beg not now (for 'tis in vain) to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But take this gift, the last that I can give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This friendly cord shall soon decide the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt my lingering love and loathsome life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This moment puts an end to all my pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall no more despair, nor thou disdain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, ungrateful and unkind! I go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemned by thee to those sad shades below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I go the extremest remedy to prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drink oblivion, and to drench my love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There happily to lose my long desires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! what draught so deep to quench my fires?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, ye never-opening gates, ye stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threshold guilty of my midnight moans!<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What I have suffered here ye know too well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I shall do, the Gods and I can tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose is fragrant, but it fades in time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violet sweet, but quickly past the prime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White lilies hang their heads, and soon decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whiter snow in minutes melts away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is your blooming youth, and withering so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time will come, it will, when you shall know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rage of love; your haughty heart shall burn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In flames like mine, and meet a like return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obdurate as you are, oh! hear at least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dying prayers, and grant my last request!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first you ope your doors, and, passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad ill-omened object meets your eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think it not lost a moment if you stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breathless wretch, so made by you, survey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some cruel pleasure will from thence arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the mighty ravage of your eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish (but oh! my wish is vain, I fear)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kind oblation of a falling tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then loose the knot, and take me from the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread your mantle o'er my grisly face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my livid lips bestow a kiss,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O envy not the dead, they feel not bliss!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fear your kisses can restore my breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even you are not more pitiless than death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then for my corpse a homely grave provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which love and me from public scorn may hide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice call upon my name, thrice beat your breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hail me thrice to everlasting rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last, let my tomb this sad inscription bear;&mdash;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">"A wretch, whom love has killed, lies buried here;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">"O passengers, Aminta's eyes beware."                  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">Thus having said, and furious with his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heaved, with more than human force, to move<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A weighty stone, (the labour of a team,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, raised from thence, he reached the neighbouring beam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around its bulk a sliding knot he throws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fitted to his neck the fatal noose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, spurning backward, took a swing, till death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept up, and stopt the passage of his breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bounce burst ope the door; the scornful fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relentless looked, and saw him beat his quivering feet in air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wept his fate, nor cast a pitying eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor took him down, but brushed regardless by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as she past, her chance or fate was such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her garments touched the dead, polluted by the touch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next to the dance, thence to the bath did move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bath was sacred to the God of Love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose injured image, with a wrathful eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood threatning from a pedestal on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nodding a while, and watchful of his blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fell, and, falling, crushed the ungrateful nymph below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her gushing blood the pavement all besmeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this her last expiring voice was heard;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lovers, farewell, revenge has reached my scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thus warned, be wise, and love for love return."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What has this bugbear, death, to frighten men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If souls can die, as well as bodies can?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as before our birth we felt no pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Punic arms infested land and main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When heaven and earth were in confusion hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the debated empire of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which awed with dreadful expectation lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure to be slaves, uncertain who should sway:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when our mortal flame shall be disjoined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lifeless lump uncoupled from the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sense of grief and pain we shall be free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall not feel, because we shall not be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though earth in seas, and seas in heaven were lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We should not move, we only should be tost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, even suppose, when we have suffered fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul could feel in her divided state.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What's that to us? for we are only we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While souls and bodies in one frame agree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, though our atoms should revolve by chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And matter leap into the former dance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though time our life and motion could restore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make our bodies what they were before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What gain to us would all this bustle bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new-made man would be another thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once an interrupting pause is made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That individual being is decayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, who are dead and gone, shall bear no part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the pleasures, nor shall feel the smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to that other mortal shall accrue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom of our matter time shall mould anew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For backward if you look on that long space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ages past, and view the changing face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of matter, tost, and variously combined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sundry shapes, 'tis easy for the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence to infer, that seeds of things have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same order as they now are seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet our dark remembrance cannot trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because a pause of life, a gaping space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has come betwixt, where memory lies dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the wandering motions from the sense are fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, whosoe'er shall in misfortunes live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must <i>be</i>, when those misfortunes shall arrive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since the man who <i>is</i> not, feels not woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For death exempts him, and wards off the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which we, the living, only feel and bear,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is there left for us in death to fear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once that pause of life has come between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis just the same as we had never been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, therefore, if a man bemoan his lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That after death his mouldering limbs shall rot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or flames, or jaws of beasts devour his mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, he's an unsincere, unthinking ass.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A secret sting remains within his mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fool is to his own cast offals kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He boasts no sense can after death remain;     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet makes himself a part of life again,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">As if some other <i>he</i> could feel the pain.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">If, while we live, this thought molest his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wolf or vulture shall devour me dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wastes his days in idle grief, nor can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinguish 'twixt the body and the man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thinks himself can still himself survive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, what when dead he feels not, feels alive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he repines that he was born to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knows in death there is no other <i>he</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No living <i>he</i> remains his grief to vent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er his senseless carcase to lament.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, after death, 'tis painful to be torn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By birds, and beasts, then why not so to burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drenched in floods of honey to be soaked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embalmed to be at once preserved and choked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or on an airy mountain's top to lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exposed to cold and heaven's inclemency;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or crowded in a tomb, to be opprest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With monumental marble on thy breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to be snatched from all the household joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy chaste wife, and thy dear prattling boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose little arms about thy legs are cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And climbing for a kiss prevent their mother's haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspiring secret pleasure through thy breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! these shall be no more; thy friends opprest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy care and courage now no more shall free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! wretch, thou criest, ah! miserable me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One woeful day sweeps children, friends, and wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the brittle blessings of my life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add one thing more, and all thou say'st is true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy want and wish of them is vanished too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, well considered, were a quick relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all thy vain imaginary grief:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For thou shalt sleep, and never wake again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, quitting life, shall quit thy loving pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we, thy friends, shall all those sorrows find,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which in forgetful death thou leav'st behind;             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">No time shall dry our tears, nor drive thee from out mind.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The worst that can befal thee, measured right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a sound slumber, and a long good-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thus the fools, that would be thought the wits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb their mirth with melancholy fits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When healths go round, and kindly brimmers flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the fresh garlands on their foreheads glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They whine, and cry, let us make haste to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short are the joys that human life can give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal preachers, that corrupt the draught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pall the god, that never thinks, with thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idiots with all that thought, to whom the worst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death, is want of drink, and endless thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any fond desire as vain as these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, even in sleep, the body, wrapt in ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supinely lies, as in the peaceful grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, wanting nothing, nothing can it crave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were that sound sleep eternal, it were death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the first atoms then, the seeds of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are moving near to sense; we do but shake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rouse that sense, and straight we are awake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then death to us, and death's anxiety,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is less than nothing, if a less could be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For then our atoms, which in order lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are scattered from their heap, and puffed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never can return into their place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once the pause of life has left an empty space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, last, suppose great Nature's voice should call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, or me, or any of us all,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dost thou mean, ungrateful wretch, thou vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mortal thing, thus idly to complain,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And sigh and sob, that thou shalt be no more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if thy life were pleasant heretofore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all the bounteous blessings I could give       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast enjoyed, if thou hast known to live,    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasure not leaked through thee like a sieve;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Why dost thou not give thanks as at a plenteous feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crammed to the throat with life, and rise and take thy rest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if my blessings thou hast thrown away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If undigested joys passed through, and would not stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why dost thou wish for more to squander still?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If life be grown a load, a real ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I would all thy cares and labours end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay down thy burden, fool, and know thy friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please thee, I have emptied all my store;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">I can invent, and can supply no more,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But run the round again, the round I ran before.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose thou art not broken yet with years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still the self-same scene of things appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would be ever, couldst thou ever live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life is still but life, there's nothing new to give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can we plead against so just a bill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stand convicted, and our cause goes ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if a wretch, a man oppressed by fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should beg of nature to prolong his date,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She speaks aloud to him with more disdain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be still, thou martyr fool, thou covetous of pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if an old decrepit sot lament,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, thou! she cries, who hast outlived content!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou complain, who hast enjoyed my store?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this is still the effect of wishing more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsatisfied with all that nature brings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loathing the present, liking absent things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hence it comes, thy vain desires, at strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within themselves, have tantalized thy life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ghastly death appeared before thy sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thou hast gorged thy soul and senses with delight.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now leave those joys, unsuiting to thy age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a fresh comer, and resign the stage.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is Nature to be blamed if thus she chide?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, sure; for 'tis her business to provide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against this ever-changing frame's decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New things to come, and old to pass away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One being, worn, another being makes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed, but not lost; for nature gives and takes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New matter must be found for things to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these must waste like those, and follow nature's doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things, like thee, have time to rise and rot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from each other's ruin are begot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life is not confined to him or thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis given to all for use, to none for property.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider former ages past and gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose circles ended long ere thine begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then tell me, fool, what part in them thou hast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus may'st thou judge the future by the past.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What horror seest thou in that quiet state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What bugbear dreams to fright thee after fate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ghost, no goblins, that still passage keep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all is there serene, in that eternal sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the dismal tales, that poets tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are verified on earth, and not in hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Tantalus looks up with fearful eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dreads the impending rock to crush him from on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fear of chance on earth disturbs our easy hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or vain imagined wrath of vain imagined powers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Tityus torn by vultures lies in hell;        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the lobes of his rank liver swell     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To that prodigious mass, for their eternal meal;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not though his monstrous bulk had covered o'er           <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nine spreading acres, or nine thousand more;             <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not though the globe of earth had been the giant's floor;<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in eternal torments could he lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could his corpse sufficient food supply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he's the Tityus, who, by love opprest,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or tyrant passion preying on his breast,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And ever anxious thoughts, is robbed of rest.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The Sisyphus is he, whom noise and strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seduce from all the soft retreats of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vex the government, disturb the laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drunk with the fumes of popular applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He courts the giddy crowd to make him great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweats and toils in vain, to mount the sovereign seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, still to aim at power, and still to fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever to strive, and never to prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it, but, in reason's true account,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heave the stone against the rising mount?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which urged, and laboured, and forced up with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recoils, and rolls impetuous down, and smokes along the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, still to treat thy ever-craving mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every blessing, and of every kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never fill thy ravening appetite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though years and seasons vary thy delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nothing to be seen of all the store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the wolf within thee barks for more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the fable's moral, which they tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fifty foolish virgins damned in hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leaky vessels, which the liquor spill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vessels of their sex, which none could ever fill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for the dog, the furies, and their snakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gloomy caverns, and the burning lakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the vain infernal trumpery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They neither are, nor were, nor e'er can be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here, on earth, the guilty have in view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty pains to mighty mischiefs due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Racks, prisons, poisons, the Tarpeian rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stripes, hangmen, pitch, and suffocating smoke;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And last, and most, if these were cast behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The avenging horror of a conscious mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose deadly fear anticipates the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees no end of punishment and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But looks for more, at the last gasp of breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This makes an hell on earth, and life a death.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime, when thoughts of death disturb thy head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consider, Ancus, great and good, is dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ancus, thy better far, was born to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many monarchs with their mighty state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ruled the world, were over-ruled by fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That haughty king, who lorded o'er the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whose stupendous bridge did the wild waves restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(In vain they foamed, in vain they threatened wreck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his proud legions marched upon their back,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him death, a greater monarch, overcame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor spared his guards the more, for their immortal name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman chief, the Carthaginian dread,         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Scipio, the thunder bolt of war, is dead,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a common slave, by fate in triumph led.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The founders of invented arts are lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wits, who made eternity their boast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now is Homer, who possessed the throne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The immortal work remains, the immortal author's gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Democritus, perceiving age invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His body weakened, and his mind decayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obeyed the summons with a cheerful face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made haste to welcome death, and met him half the race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stroke even Epicurus could not bar,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Though he in wit surpassed mankind, as far <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">As does the mid-day sun the midnight star.  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, dost thou disdain to yield thy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose very life is little more than death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than one half by lazy sleep possest;             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And when awake, thy soul but nods at best,            <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Day-dreams and sickly thoughts revolving in thy breast<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal troubles haunt thy anxious mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose cause and cure thou never hop'st to find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still uncertain, with thyself at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wanderest in the labyrinth of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, if the foolish race of man, who find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weight of cares still pressing on their mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could find as well the cause of this unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all this burden lodged within the breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure they would change their course, nor live as now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain what to wish, or what to vow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uneasy both in country and in town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They search a place to lay their burden down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, restless in his palace, walks abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vainly thinks to leave behind the load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strait returns; for he's as restless there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finds there's no relief in open air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another to his villa would retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spurs as hard as if it were on fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner entered at his country door,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But he begins to stretch, and yawn, and snore,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or seeks the city, which he left before       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus every man o'erworks his weary will,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To shun himself, and to shake off his ill;        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The shaking fit returns, and hangs upon him still.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">No prospect of repose, nor hope of ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretch is ignorant of his disease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, known, would all his fruitless trouble spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he would know the world not worth his care:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then would he search more deeply for the cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And study nature well, and nature's laws;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For in this moment lies not the debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on our future, fixed, eternal state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never-changing state, which all must keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom death has doomed to everlasting sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why are we then so fond of mortal life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beset with dangers, and maintained with strife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life, which all our care can never save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One fate attends us, and one common grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, we tread but a perpetual round;              <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">We ne'er strike out, but beat the former ground,      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the same maukish joys in the same track are found.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For still we think an absent blessing best,  <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Which cloys, and is no blessing when possest;<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">A new arising wish expels it from the breast.<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The feverish thirst of life increases still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We call for more and more, and never have our fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet know not what to-morrow we shall try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dregs of life in the last draught may lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, by the longest life we can attain,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">One moment from the length of death we gain;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For all behind belongs to his eternal reign.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When once the fates have cut the mortal thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man as much to all intents is dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dies to-day, and will as long be so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he who died a thousand years ago.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus, therefore, he, who feels the fiery dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of strong desire transfix his amorous heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether some beauteous boy's alluring face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lovelier maid, with unresisting grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her each part the winged arrow sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whence he first was struck he thither tends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restless he roams, impatient to be freed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eager to inject the sprightly seed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fierce desire does all his mind employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ardent love assures approaching joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the nature of that pleasing smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose burning drops distil upon the heart,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The fever of the soul shot from the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold ague of succeeding care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If absent, her idea still appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her sweet name is chiming in your ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strive those pleasing phantoms to remove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shun the aërial images of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That feed the flame: when one molests thy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discharge thy loins on all the leaky kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that's a wiser way, than to restrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within thy swelling nerves that hoard of pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every hour some deadlier symptom shews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by delay the gathering venom grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When kindly applications are not used;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scorpion, love, must on the wound be bruised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that one object 'tis not safe to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But force the tide of thought some other way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The squandered spirits prodigally throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the common glebe of nature sow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wants he all the bliss that lovers feign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who takes the pleasure, and avoids the pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For purer joys in purer health abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And less affect the sickly than the sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When love its utmost vigour does employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even then 'tis but a restless wandering joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knows the lover in that wild excess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands or eyes, what first he would possess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strains at all, and, fastening where he strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too closely presses with his frantic pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With biting kisses hurts the twining fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shews his joys imperfect, insincere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, stung with inward rage, he flings around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strives to avenge the smart on that which gave the wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love those eager bitings does restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mingling pleasure mollifies the pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ardent hope still flatters anxious grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sends him to his foe to seek relief:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet the nature of the thing denies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love, and love alone of all our joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By full possession does but fan the fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more we still enjoy, the more we still desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature for meat and drink provides a space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when received, they fill their certain place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence thirst and hunger may be satisfied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this repletion is to love denied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Form, feature, colour, whatsoe'er delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provokes the lover's endless appetite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These fill no space, nor can we thence remove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lips, or hands, or all our instruments of love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In our deluded grasp we nothing find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thin a&euml;rial shapes, that fleet before the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he, who in a dream with drought is curst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finds no real drink to quench his thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs to imagined lakes his heat to steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vainly swills and labours in his sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So love with phantoms cheats our longing eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which hourly seeing never satisfies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hands pull nothing from the parts they strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wander o'er the lovely limbs in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor when the youthful pair more closely join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When hands in hands they lock, and thighs in thighs they twine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just in the raging foam of full desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When both press on, both murmur, both expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gripe, they squeeze, their humid tongues they dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As each would force their way to t'other's heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain; they only cruize about the coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For bodies cannot pierce, nor be in bodies lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sure they strive to be, when both engage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that tumultuous momentary rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tangled in the nets of love they lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till man dissolves in that excess of joy.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the gathered bag has burst its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ebbing tides the slackened nerves betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pause ensues; and nature nods awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with recruited rage new spirits boil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the same vain violence returns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flames renewed the erected furnace burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again they in each other would be lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still by adamantine bars are crost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ways they try, successless all they prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cure the secret sore of lingering love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They waste their strength in the venereal strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to a woman's will enslave their life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The estate runs out, and mortgages are made,   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">All offices of friendship are decayed,         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their fortune ruined, and their fame betrayed. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Assyrian ointment from their temples flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And diamond buckles sparkle in their shoes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheerful emerald twinkles on their hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the luxury of foreign lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blue coat, that with embroidery shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is drunk with sweat of their o'er-laboured loins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their frugal father's gains they misemploy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn to point, and pearl, and every female toy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">French fashions, costly treats are their delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The park by day, and plays and balls by night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the fountain, where their sweets are sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bitter bubbles up, and poisons all the draught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, guilty conscience does the mirror bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sharp remorse shoots out her angry sting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anxious thoughts, within themselves at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upbraid the long mispent, luxurious life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, the fickle fair-one proves unkind,    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or drops a doubtful word, that pains his mind, <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves a rankling jealousy behind.         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, he watches close her amorous eyes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And thinks he sees upon her cheeks the while             <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

<span class="i0">His raging pulse beats thick, and his pent spirits boil. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">This is the product e'en of prosperous love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think then what pangs disastrous passions prove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innumerable ills; disdain, despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the meagre family of care.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, as I said, 'tis better to prevent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than flatter the disease, and late repent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because to shun the allurement is not hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To minds resolved, forewarned, and well prepared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wonderous difficult, when once beset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To struggle through the straits, and break the involving net.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, thus ensnared, thy freedom thou may'st gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, like a fool, thou dost not hug thy chain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not to ruin obstinately blind,      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And wilfully endeavouring not to find  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her plain defects of body and of mind. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For thus the Bedlam train of lovers use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enhance the value, and the faults excuse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore 'tis no wonder if we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They doat on dowdies and deformity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even what they cannot praise, they will not blame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But veil with some extenuating name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sallow skin is for the swarthy put,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love can make a slattern of a slut;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If cat-eyed, then a Pallas is their love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If freckled, she's a party-coloured dove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If little, then she's life and soul all o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Amazon, the large two-handed whore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stammers; oh what grace in lisping lies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she says nothing, to be sure she's wise.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
<span class="i0">If shrill, and with a voice to drown a quire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp-witted she must be, and full of fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lean, consumptive wench, with coughs decayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is called a pretty, tight, and slender maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The o'er-grown, a goodly Ceres is exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bedfellow for Bacchus at the least;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flat-nose the name of Satyr never misses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hanging blobber lips but pout for kisses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The task were endless all the rest to trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet grant she were a Venus for her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shape, yet others equal beauty share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And time was you could live without the fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She does no more, in that for which you woo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than homelier women full as well can do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, she daubs, and stinks so much of paint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her own attendants cannot bear the scent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But laugh behind, and bite their lips to hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, excluded, and exposed to cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whining lover stands before the gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there with humble adoration waits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowning with flowers the threshold and the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And printing kisses on the obdurate door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, if admitted in that nick of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If some unsavoury whiff betray the crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invents a quarrel straight, if there be none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or makes some faint excuses to be gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls himself a doating fool to serve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascribing more than woman can deserve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which well they understand, like cunning queans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide their nastiness behind the scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From him they have allured, and would retain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to a piercing eye 'tis all in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For common sense brings all their cheats to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the false light discovers by the true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which a wise harlot owns, and hopes to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pardon for defects, that run through all the kind.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor always do they feign the sweets of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When round the panting youth their pliant limbs they move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cling, and heave and moisten every kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They often share, and more than share the bliss:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every part, even to their inmost soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They feel the trickling joys, and run with vigour to the goal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred with the same impetuous desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birds, beasts, and herds, and mares, their males require;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the throbbing nature in their veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provokes them to assuage their kindly pains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lusty leap the expecting female stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mutual heat compelled to mutual bands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus dogs with lolling tongues by love are tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shouting boys nor blows their union can divide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At either end they strive the link to loose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, for stronger Venus holds the noose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which never would those wretched lovers do,            <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But that the common heats of love they know;           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure therefore must be shared in common too:   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And when the woman's more prevailing juice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sucks in the man's, the mixture will produce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother's likeness; when the man prevails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own resemblance in the seed he seals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when we see the new-begotten race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflect the features of each parent's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then of the father's and the mother's blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The justly tempered seed is understood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When both conspire, with equal ardour bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every limb the due proportion sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When neither party foils, when neither foiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This gives the splendid features of the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the boy the grandsire's image bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the more remote progenitor he shares;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Because the genial atoms of the seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie long concealed ere they exert the breed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, after sundry ages past, produce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tardy likeness of the latent juice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, families such different figures take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And represent their ancestors in face, and hair, and make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of the same seed, the voice, and hair,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And shape, and face, and other members are,           <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the same antique mould the likeness does prepare. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, oft the father's likeness does prevail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In females, and the mother's in the male;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since the seed is of a double kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that, where we the most resemblance find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may conclude the strongest tincture sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was in conception prevalent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can the vain decrees of powers above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deny production to the act of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hinder fathers of that happy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with a barren womb the matron shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many think, who stain with victims blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful altars, and with incense load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bless the showery seed with future life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to impregnate the well-laboured wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain they weary heaven with prayer, or fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To oracles, or magic numbers try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For barrenness of sexes will proceed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either from too condensed, or watery, seed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watery juice too soon dissolves away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the parts projected will not stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The too condensed, unsouled, unwieldy mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drops short, nor carries to the destined place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pierces to the parts, nor, though injected home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will mingle with the kindly moisture of the womb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nuptials are unlike in their success;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some men with fruitful seed some women bless,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And from some men some women fruitful are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as their constitutions join or jar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many seeming barren wives have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who after, matched with more prolific men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have filled a family with prattling boys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many, not supplied at home with joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have found a friend abroad to ease their smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to perform the sapless husband's part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much it does import, that seed with seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should of the kindly mixture make the breed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thick with thin, and thin with thick should join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So to produce and propagate the line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such concernment too is drink and food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To incrassate, or attenuate the blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of like importance is the posture too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the genial feat of love we do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as the females of the four-foot kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive the leapings of their males behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the good wives, with loins uplifted high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaning on their hands, the fruitful stroke may try:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in that posture will they best conceive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not when, supinely laid, they frisk and heave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For active motions only break the blow,                       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And more of strumpets than the wives they show,               <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">When, answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throw off the plow-share from the furrowed ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But common harlots in conjunction heave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because 'tis less their business to conceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to delight, and to provoke the deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trick which honest wives but little need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it from the gods, or Cupid's dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That many a homely woman takes the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wives well-humoured, dutiful, and chaste,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And clean, will hold their wandering husbands fast;    <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the links of love, and such a love will last. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For what remains, long habitude, and use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will kindness in domestic bands produce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For custom will a strong impression leave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard bodies, which the lightest stroke receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In length of time will moulder and decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stones with drops of rain are washed away.<br /></span>

<p><a id="Footnote_BK_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BK_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Wentworth Dillon, Earl of Roscommon, an elegant poet and
accomplished nobleman, was created captain of the band of pensioners
after the Restoration, and made a considerable figure at the
court of Charles II. But, having injured his fortune by gaming,
and being engaged in a lawsuit with the Lord Privy Seal concerning
a considerable part of his estate, he found himself obliged to retire
to Ireland, and resigned his post at the English court. After
having resided some years in that kingdom, where he enjoyed the
post of captain of the guards to the Duke of Ormond, he returned
to England, where he died in 1684. Besides the ode which follows,
there are several traces through Dryden's works of his intimacy
with Roscommon.</p></div></div>

<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>Chryses, priest of Apollo, brings presents to the Grecian princes, to
ransom his daughter Chryseis, who was prisoner in the fleet.
Agamemnon, the general, whose captive and mistress the young
lady was, refuses to deliver her, threatens the venerable old man, and
dismisses him with contumely. The priest craves vengeance of
his God, who sends a plague among the Greeks; which occasions
Achilles, their great champion, to summon a council of the chief
officers: he encourages Calchas, the high priest and prophet, to
tell the reason, why the Gods were so much incensed against them.
Calchas is fearful of provoking Agamemnon, till Achilles engages
to protect him: then, emboldened by the hero, he accuses the general
as the cause of all, by detaining the fair captive, and refusing
the presents offered for her ransom. By this proceeding,
Agamemnon is obliged, against his will, to restore Chryseis, with
gifts, that he might appease the wrath of Ph&oelig;bus; but, at the
same time, to revenge himself on Achilles, sends to seize his slave
Briseis. Achilles, thus affronted, complains to his mother Thetis;
and begs her to revenge his injury, not only on the general,
but on all the army, by giving victory to the Trojans, till the ungrateful
king became sensible of his injustice. At the same time,
he retires from the camp into his ships, and withdraws his aid
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
from his countrymen. Thetis prefers her son's petition to Jupiter,
who grants her suit. Juno suspects her errand, and quarrels
with her husband for his grant; till Vulcan reconciles his parents
with a bowl of nectar, and sends them peaceably to bed.</i></p></blockquote>

<span class="i0">And homely household-task, shall be her doom,                <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Far from thy loved embrace, and her sweet native home.&mdash;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">He said: the helpless priest replied no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sped his steps along the hoarse-resounding shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent he fled; secure at length he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devoutly cursed his foes, and thus invoked his God:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O source of sacred light, attend my prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God with the silver bow, and golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Chrysa, Cilla, Tenedos obeys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whose broad eye their happy soil surveys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, Smintheus, I have poured before thy shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood of oxen, goats, and ruddy wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And larded thighs on loaded altars laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, and my just revenge propitious aid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierce the proud Greeks, and with thy shafts attest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much thy power is injured in thy priest.&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
<span class="i2">He prayed; and Ph&oelig;bus, hearing, urged his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury kindled, from Olympus' height;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His quiver o'er his ample shoulders threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bow twanged, and his arrows rattled as they flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black as a stormy night, he ranged around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tents, and compassed the devoted ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with full force his deadly bow he bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feathered fates among the mules and sumpters sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The essay of rage; on faithful dogs the next;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last, in human hearts his arrows fixed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God nine days the Greeks at rovers killed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine days the camp with funeral fires was filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tenth, Achilles, by the queen's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bears heaven's awful sceptre in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A council summoned; for the goddess grieved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her favoured host should perish unrelieved.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The kings, assembled, soon their chief inclose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from his seat the goddess-born arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus undaunted spoke:&mdash;What now remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that once more we tempt the watery plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, wandering homeward, seek our safety hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In flight at least, if we can find defence?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such woes at once encompass us about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plague within the camp, the sword without.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consult, O king, the prophets of the event;               <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And whence these ills, and what the God's intent,         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Let them by dreams explore, for dreams from Jove are sent.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What want of offered victims, what offence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact committed could the Sun incense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deal his deadly shafts? What may remove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His settled hate, and reconcile his love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he may look propitious on our toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hungry graves no more be glutted with our spoils.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus to the king of men the hero spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Calchas the desired occasion took;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Calchas, the sacred seer, who had in view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things present and the past, and things to come foreknew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supreme of augurs, who, by Ph&oelig;bus taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian powers to Troy's destruction brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilled in the secret causes of their woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reverend priest in graceful act arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus bespoke Pelides:&mdash;Care of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favoured of all the immortal powers above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou the seeds deep sown of mischief know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why, provoked, Apollo bends his bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plight first thy faith, inviolably true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save me from those ills that may ensue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I shall tell ungrateful truths to those,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose boundless powers of life and death dispose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sovereigns, ever jealous of their state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive not those whom once they mark for hate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even though the offence they seemingly digest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revenge, like embers raked within their breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bursts forth in flames, whose unresisted power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will seize the unwary wretch, and soon devour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, and no less, is he, on whom depends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sum of things, and whom my tongue of force offends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure me then from his foreseen intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what his wrath may doom, thy valour may prevent.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this the stern Achilles made reply:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be bold, (and on my plighted faith rely,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak what Ph&oelig;bus has inspired thy soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For common good, and speak without controul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His godhead I invoke; by him I swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That while my nostrils draw this vital air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None shall presume to violate those bands,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or touch thy person with unhallowed hands;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Even not the king of men, that all commands.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
<span class="i2">At this, resuming heart, the prophet said:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hecatomb unslain, nor vows unpaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Greeks accursed this dire contagion bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or call for vengeance from the bowyer king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he the tyrant, whom none dares resist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affronts the godhead in his injured priest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He keeps the damsel captive in his chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And presents are refused, and prayers preferred in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this the avenging power employs his darts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empties all his quiver in our hearts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus will persist, relentless in his ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the fair slave be rendered to her sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ransom-free restored to his abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sacrifice to reconcile the God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he, perhaps, atoned by prayer, may cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vengeance justly vowed, and give the peace.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus having said, he sate:&mdash;Thus answered then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upstarting from his throne, the king of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His breast with fury filled, his eyes with fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rolling round, he shot in sparkles on the sire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Augur of ill, whose tongue was never found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a priestly curse, or boding sound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not one blessed event foretold to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed through that mouth, or passed unwillingly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now thou dost with lies the throne invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By practice hardened in thy slandering trade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obtending heaven, for whate'er ills befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sputtering under specious names thy gall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Ph&oelig;bus is provoked, his rites and laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are in his priest profaned, and I the cause;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I detain a slave, my sovereign prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacred gold, your idol-god, despise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love her well; and well her merits claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stand preferred before my Grecian dame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Clytemnestra's self in beauty's bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More charmed, or better plied the various loom:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Mine is the maid, and brought in happy hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every household-grace adorned, to bless my nuptial bower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall she be restored, since public good   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For private interest ought not to be withstood,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To save the effusion of my people's blood.     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But right requires, if I resign my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should not suffer for your sakes alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone excluded from the prize I gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by your common suffrage have obtained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slave without a ransom shall be sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rests for you to make the equivalent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this the fierce Thessalian prince replied:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O first in power, but passing all in pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griping, and still tenacious of thy hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would'st thou the Grecian chiefs, though largely souled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should give the prizes they had gained before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with their loss thy sacrilege restore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er by force of arms the soldier got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is each his own, by dividend of lot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to resume were both unjust and base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be borne but by a servile race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this we can; if Saturn's son bestows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sack of Troy, which he by promise owes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the conquering Greeks thy loss restore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with large interest make the advantage more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this Atrides answered:&mdash;Though thy boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assumes the foremost name of all our host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretend not, mighty man, that what is mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Controuled by thee, I tamely should resign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I release the prize I gained by right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In taken towns, and many a bloody fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thou detain'st Briseis in thy bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By priestly glossing on the God's commands?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolve on this, (a short alternative,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quit mine, or, in exchange, another give;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Else I, assure thy soul, by sovereign right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will seize thy captive in thy own despite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from stout Ajax, or Ulysses, bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What other prize my fancy shall prefer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then softly murmur, or aloud complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rage as you please, you shall resist in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But more of this, in proper time and place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To things of greater moment let us pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ship to sail the sacred seas prepare,              <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Proud in her trim, and put on board the fair,        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With sacrifice and gifts, and all the pomp of prayer.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">The crew well chosen, the command shall be          <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In Ajax; or if other I decree,                      <span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">In Creta's king, or Ithacus, or, if I please, in thee:<span class="ir1a">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Most fit thyself to see performed the intent,         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">For which my prisoner from my sight is sent,          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">(Thanks to thy pious care,) that Ph&oelig;bus may relent.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">At this Achilles rolled his furious eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on the king askant, and thus replies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, impudent, regardful of thy own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose thoughts are centered on thyself alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced to sovereign sway for better ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than thus like abject slaves to treat thy friends!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Greek is he, that, urged by thy command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the Trojan troops will lift his hand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not I; nor such enforced respect I owe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Pergamus I hate, nor Priam is my foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wrong from Troy remote could I sustain,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To leave my fruitful soil and happy reign,  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And plough the surges of the stormy main?   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, frontless man, we followed from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy instruments of death, and tools of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine is the triumph; ours the toil alone;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now thou threaten'st, with unjust decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To punish thy affronting heaven on me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seize the prize which I so dearly bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By common suffrage given, confirmed by lot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mean match to thine; for, still above the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hooked rapacious hands usurp the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though mine are first in fight, to force the prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last sustain the labours of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor grudge I thee the much the Grecians give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor murmuring take the little I receive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet even this little, thou, who wouldst ingross<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The king, whose brows with shining gold were bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saw his throne with sceptered slaves encompassed round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus answered stern:&mdash;Go, at thy pleasure, go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We need not such a friend, nor fear we such a foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will not want to follow me in fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove will assist, and Jove assert my right:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou of all the kings (his care below)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art least at my command, and most my foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Debates, dissensions, uproars are thy joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provoked without offence, and practised to destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strength is of brutes, and not thy boast alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least 'tis lent from heaven, and not thy own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly then, ill-mannered, to thy native land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there thy ant-born Myrmidons command.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But mark this menace; since I must resign<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A well-rigged vessel in the port attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manned at my charge, commanded by my friends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship shall waft her to her wished abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full fraught with holy bribes to the far-shooting God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This thus dispatched, I owe myself the care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fame and injured honour to repair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy own tent, proud man, in thy despite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hand shall ravish thy pretended right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Briseis shall be mine, and thou shalt see                         <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">What odds of awful power I have on thee,                          <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That others at thy cost may learn the difference of degree.&mdash;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i2">At this the impatient hero sourly smiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart impetuous in his bosom boiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, jostled by two tides of equal sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood for a while suspended in his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt his reason and his rage untamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One whispered soft, and one aloud reclaimed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That only counselled to the safer side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This to the sword his ready hand applied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpunished to support the affront was hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor easy was the attempt to force the guard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the thirst of vengeance fired his blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half shone his faulchion, and half sheathed it stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In that nice moment, Pallas, from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commissioned by the imperial wife of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descended swift; (the white-armed Queen was loath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fight should follow, for she favoured both;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as in act he stood, in clouds enshrined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand she fastened on his hair behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then backward by his yellow curls she drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him, and him alone, confessed in view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tamed by superior force, he turned his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aghast at first, and stupid with surprise;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But by her sparkling eyes, and ardent look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The virgin-warrior known, he thus bespoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Com'st thou, Celestial, to behold my wrongs?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the vengeance which to crimes belongs?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus he.&mdash;The blue-eyed Goddess thus rejoined:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If reason will resume her sovereign sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sent by Juno, her commands obey.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then give thy guardian Gods their due respect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cease contention; be thy words severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp as he merits; but the sword forbear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour unhoped already wings her way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he his dire affront shall dearly pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the proud king shall sue, with treble gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quit thy loss, and conquer thy disdain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, secure of my unfailing word,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The youth thus answered mild:&mdash;Auspicious maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's will be mine, and your commands obeyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods are just, and when, subduing sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We serve their Powers, provide the recompence.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said; with surly faith believed her word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the sheath, reluctant, plunged the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her message done, she mounts the blessed abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mixed among the senate of the Gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At her departure his disdain returned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire she fanned with greater fury burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rumbling within till thus it found a vent:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dastard and drunkard, mean and insolent!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tongue-valiant hero, vaunter of thy might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In threats the foremost, but the lag in fight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When didst thou thrust amid the mingled preace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content to bide the war aloof in peace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms are the trade of each plebeian soul;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lord-like at ease, with arbitrary power,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Assume thy power, assert thy providence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Troy prevail, till Greece the affront has paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With doubled honours, and redeemed his aid.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She ceased; but the considering God was mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she, resolved to win, renewed her suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor loosed her hold, but forced him to reply:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grant me my petition, or deny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove cannot fear; then tell me to my face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I, of all the gods, am least in grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I can bear.&mdash;The cloud-compeller mourned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sighing first, this answer he returned.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Know'st thou what clamours will disturb my reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What my stunned ears from Juno must sustain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In council she gives licence to her tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loquacious, brawling, ever in the wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now she will my partial power upbraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, alienate from Greece, I give the Trojans aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou depart, and shun her jealous sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The care be mine to do Pelides right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go then, and on the faith of Jove rely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, nodding to thy suit, he bows the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This ratifies the irrevocable doom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sign ordained, that what I will shall come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stamp of heaven, and seal of fate.&mdash;He said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook the sacred honours of his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With terror trembled heaven's subsiding hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his shaken curls ambrosial dews distil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess goes exulting from his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeks the seas profound, and leaves the realms of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He moves into his hall; the Powers resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each from his house, to fill the sovereign's court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor waiting summons, nor expecting stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But met with reverence, and received the God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mounts the throne; and Juno took her place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sullen discontent sate lowering on her face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With jealous eyes, at distance she had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispering with Jove, the silver-footed queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, impotent of tongue, her silence broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus turbulent, in rattling tone, she spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Author of ills, and close contriver Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of thy dames, what prostitute of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has held thy ear so long, and begged so hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some old service done, some new reward?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apart you talked, for that's your special care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consort never must the council share.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One gracious word is for a wife too much;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is a marriage vow, and Jove's own faith is such.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Then thus the sire of Gods, and men below:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I have hidden, hope not thou to know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even goddesses are women; and no wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has power to regulate her husband's life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counsel she may; and I will give thy ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knowledge first of what is fit to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I transact with others, or alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beware to learn, nor press too near the throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom the Goddess, with the charming eyes:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When did I search the secrets of thy reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though privileged to know, but privileged in vain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But well thou dost, to hide from common sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy close intrigues, too bad to bear the light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor doubt I, but the silver-footed dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tripping from sea, on such an errand came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grace her issue at the Grecians' cost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for one peevish man, destroy an host.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom the Thunderer made this stern reply:&mdash;<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">My household curse! my lawful plague! the spy      <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove's designs! his other squinting eye!        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Why this vain prying, and for what avail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove will be master still, and Juno fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should thy suspicious thoughts divine aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou but becom'st more odious to my sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this attempt; uneasy life to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still watched and importuned, but worse for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curb that impetuous tongue, before too late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods behold, and tremble at thy fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitying, but daring not, in thy defence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift a hand against Omnipotence.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This heard, the imperious queen sate mute with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor further durst incense the gloomy Thunderer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence was in the court at this rebuke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the Gods abashed sustain their sovereign's look.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The limping Smith observed the saddened feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hopping here and there, himself a jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put in his word, that neither might offend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Jove obsequious, yet his mother's friend.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What end in heaven will be of civil war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Gods of pleasure will for mortals jar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such discord but disturbs our jovial feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One grain of bad embitters all the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, though wise yourself, my counsel weigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis much unsafe my sire to disobey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only you provoke him to your cost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mirth is marred, and the good chear is lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempt not his heavy hand, for he has power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw you headlong from his heavenly tower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one submissive word, which you let fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will make him in good humour with us all.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said no more, but crowned a bowl unbid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laughing nectar overlooked the lid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then put it to her hand, and thus pursued:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cursed quarrel be no more renewed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be, as becomes a wife, obedient still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though grieved, yet subject to her husband's will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not see you beaten; yet afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove's superior force, I dare not aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too well I know him, since that hapless hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I, and all the Gods, employed our power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break your bonds; me by the heel he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er heaven's battlements with fury threw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day I fell; my flight at morn begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ended not but with the setting sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitched on my head, at length the Lemnian ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received my battered skull, the Sinthians healed my wound.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At Vulcan's homely mirth his mother smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, smiling, took the cup the clown had filled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reconciler-bowl went round the board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, emptied, the rude skinker still restored.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Loud fits of laughter seized the guests, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limping God so deft<a id="FNanchor_BN_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> at his new ministry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feast continued till declining light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They drank, they laughed, they loved, and then 'twas night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wanted tuneful harp, nor vocal quire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muses sung, Apollo touched the lyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drunken at last, and drowsy, they depart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each to his house, adorned with laboured art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the lame architect. The thundering God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even he, withdrew to rest, and had his load;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His swimming head to needful sleep applied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Juno lay unheeded by his side.<br /></span>

and his brother Paris, who had fought unsuccessfully, hand

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus having said, brave Hector went to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His virtuous wife, the fair Andromache.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He found her not at home; for she was gone,<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Attended by her maid and infant son,       <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">To climb the steepy tower of Ilion;        <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">From whence, with heavy heart, she might survey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bloody business of the dreadful day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mournful eyes she cast around the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the lord of her desires in vain.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But he, who thought his peopled palace bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she, his only comfort, was not there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in the gate, and asked of every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which way she took, and whither she was gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If to the court, or with his mother's train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In long procession to Minerva's fane?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The servants answered,&mdash;Neither to the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Priam's sons and daughters did resort;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to the temple was she gone, to move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With prayers the blue-eyed progeny of Jove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But more solicitous for him alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all their safety, to the tower was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to survey the labours of the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the Greeks conquer, and the Trojans yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly she passed, with fear and fury wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nurse went lagging after with the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This heard, the noble Hector made no stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The admiring throng divide to give him way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed through every street, by which he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the gate he met the mournful dame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His wife beheld him; and, with eager pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew to his arms, to meet a dear embrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife, who brought in dower Cilicia's crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in herself a greater dower alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aetion's heir, who, on the woody plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hippoplacus, did in Theb&eacute; reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless she flew, with joy and passion wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nurse came lagging after with the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The royal babe upon her breast was laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, like the morning star, his beams displayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scamandrius was his name, which Hector gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that fair flood which Ilion's wall did lave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But him Astyanax the Trojans call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his great father who defends the wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hector beheld him with a silent smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tender wife stood weeping by the while;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Pressed in her own, his warlike hand she took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sighed, and thus prophetically spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy dauntless heart, which I foresee too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too daring man, will urge thee to thy fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dost thou pity, with a parent's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This helpless orphan, whom thou leav'st behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor me, the unhappy partner of thy bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who must in triumph by the Greeks be led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seek thy life; and, in unequal fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many, will oppress thy single might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better it were for miserable me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die, before the fate which I foresee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, ah! what comfort can the world bequeath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hector's widow, after Hector's death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal sorrow and perpetual tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began my youth, and will conclude my years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no parents, friends, nor brothers left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By stern Achilles all of life bereft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the walls of Thebes he overthrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fatal hand my royal father slew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He slew Aetion, but despoiled him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in his hate the funeral rites forgot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed as he was he sent him whole below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reverenced thus the manes of his foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tomb he raised; the mountain-nymphs around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enclosed, with planted elms, the holy ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My seven brave brothers, in one fatal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death's dark mansions took the mournful way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slain by the same Achilles, while they keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bellowing oxen, and the bleating sheep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, who the royal sceptre swayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was captive to the cruel victor made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hither led; but, hence redeemed with gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her native country did again behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but beheld; for soon Diana's dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In an unhappy chace, transfixed her heart.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But thou, my Hector, art thyself alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My parents, brothers, and my lord, in one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, kill not all my kindred o'er again,     <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tempt the dangers of the dusty plain   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But in this tower, for our defence, remain.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wife and son are in thy ruin lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a husband's and a father's post.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sc&aelig;an gate commands the plains below;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">Here marshal all thy soldiers as they go;  <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And hence, with other hands, repel the foe.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">By yon wild fig-tree lies their chief ascent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thither all their powers are daily bent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two Ajaces have I often seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wronged husband of the Spartan queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him his greater brother; and, with these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce Diomede, and bold Meriones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain if by augury, or chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by this easy rise they all advance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guard well that pass, secure of all beside.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the noble Hector thus replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That and the rest are in my daily care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, should I shun the dangers of the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorn the Trojans would reward my pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their proud ladies, with their sweeping trains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian swords and lances I can bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But loss of honour is my only fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall Hector, born to war, his birth-right yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belie his courage, and forsake the field?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Early in rugged arms I took delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still have been the foremost in the fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dangers dearly have I bought renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And am the champion of my father's crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet my mind forebodes, with sure presage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Troy shall perish by the Grecian rage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal day draws on, when I must fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And universal ruin cover all.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Not Troy itself, though built by hands divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Priam, nor his people, nor his line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, nor my brothers of renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose valour yet defends the unhappy town,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not these, nor all their fates which I foresee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are half of that concern I have for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see, I see thee, in that fatal hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subjected to the victor's cruel power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led hence a slave to some insulting sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn, and trembling at a foreign lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spectacle in Argos, at the loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gracing with Trojan fights, a Grecian room;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from deep wells the living stream to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on thy weary shoulders bring it back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, groaning under this laborious life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They insolently call thee Hector's wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upbraid thy bondage with thy husband's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from my glory propagate thy shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This when they say, thy sorrows will increase<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">With anxious thoughts of former happiness;   <span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">That he is dead who could thy wrongs redress.<span class="ir1">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">But I, oppressed with iron sleep before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hear thy unavailing cries no more.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, holding forth his arms, he took his boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pledge of love and other hope of Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fearful infant turned his head away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his nurse's neck reclining lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His unknown father shunning with affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking back on so uncouth a sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daunted to see a face with steel o'erspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his high plume that nodded o'er his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sire and mother smiled with silent joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hector hastened to relieve his boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismissed his burnished helm, that shone afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride of warriors, and the pomp of war;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The illustrious babe, thus reconciled, he took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hugged in his arms, and kissed, and thus he spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Parent of Gods and men, propitious Jove!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, bright synod of the powers above!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this my son your gracious gifts bestow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant him to live, and great in arms to grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reign in Troy, to govern with renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield the people, and assert the crown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, when hereafter he from war shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring his Trojans peace and triumph home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some aged man, who lives this act to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who, in former times, remembered me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May say, the son, in fortitude and fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outgoes the mark, and drowns his father's name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, at these words, his mother may rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And add her suffrage to the public voice.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus having said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He first, with suppliant hands, the Gods adored;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the mother's arms the child restored.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
